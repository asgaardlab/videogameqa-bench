                        With video games now generating the highest revenues in the entertainment industry, optimizing
                        game development workflows has become essential for the sector's sustained growth. Recent
                        advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer considerable potential to automate and
                        enhance various aspects of game development, particularly Quality Assurance (QA), which remains
                        one of the industry's most labor-intensive processes with limited automation options. To
                        accurately evaluate the performance of VLMs in video game QA tasks and determine their
                        effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios, there is a clear need for standardized
                        benchmarks, as existing benchmarks are insufficient to address the specific requirements of this
                        domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoGameQA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that
                        covers a wide array of game QA activities, including visual unit testing, visual regression
                        testing, needle-in-a-haystack tasks, glitch detection, and bug report generation for both images
                        and videos of various games.

        <h1>
            Introduction
        </h1>
        <p>
            The global video game industry continues to expand rapidly, with its market value projected to reach $257
            billion by
            2028. Alongside this substantial growth, the process of developing high-quality video games remains
            inherently
            complex and demanding. A critical challenge within game development is to ensure visual quality and
            consistency
            through a rigorous visual testing and quality assurance (QA) process. Automation of visual QA tasks remains
            particularly challenging, and currently, most visual QA relies heavily on manual inspection, making the
            process
            time-consuming, costly, labor-intensive, and prone to human error.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            The visual QA process for video games can generally be abstracted into three main types of tasks:
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Verifying scene integrity</strong> by comparing the visual representation of scenes against
            intended
            configurations and known reference states, such as an oracle or previously rendered versions of the same
            scenes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Detecting glitches</strong> through open-ended exploration—these glitches are unintended
            gameplay or
            visual artifacts without specific reference points, requiring testers to rely on common sense and
            general
            knowledge for detection.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Systematically reporting and documenting</strong> all identified glitches, ensuring developers
            receive
            clear and actionable information to address problems effectively during game development.
        </li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <p>
            Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) present promising opportunities to automate and
            significantly
            enhance the efficiency of video game QA. However, progress in applying VLMs to game QA has been limited by
            the lack
            of standardized benchmarks. Current multimodal benchmarks tend to focus heavily on complex mathematical or
            textual
            reasoning tasks, overlooking essential visual comprehension tasks fundamental to video game QA. Similarly,
            existing
            game-specific benchmarks often represent only narrow aspects of QA tasks, thus inadequately evaluating and
            tracking
            VLM performance across diverse QA scenarios.

            Our Contributions
        </h1>
        <p>
            In this paper, we introduce <strong>GameQA-Benchmark</strong>, a benchmark designed to fill the gap in
            evaluating
            VLMs for video game QA. Our key findings and contributions are as follows:
        </p>
        <br>

        <ol>
            <li>
                We present <strong>VideoGameQA-Benchmark</strong> featuring 9 distinct tasks and a large set of
                questions
                designed
                considering real-world video game development scenarios, such as visual unit testing, regression
                testing, UI
                validation, video needle-in-a-haystack, and glitch detection.
            </li>
            <li>
                While VLMs show promising performance on various multimodal benchmarks and can function as OCR systems,
                they
                perform poorly at detecting fine details required for accurate scene understanding and parsing complex
                UI
                elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Frontier VLMs show good performance on the glitch detection task using images (up to 82.8%) and videos
                (up to
                78.1%); however, all struggle when it comes to glitches related to body configuration, intricate object
                clipping, and common-sense reasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Visual regression testing remains one of the most challenging tasks for VLMs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Locating specific glitch moments in videos remains a challenge, both in detecting and accurately
                pinpointing the
                glitch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Frontier VLMs can generate useful bug reports for up to 50% of real-world glitches, providing accurate
                and
                descriptive summaries of the glitches.

        <p>
            We designed <strong>VideoGameQA-Benchmark</strong>'s tasks by simulating realistic QA scenarios encountered
            during actual video game development. However, to make the benchmark more relevant for future QA automation
            tasks, we also included tasks that may challenge current software engineering practices while also remaining
            highly
            relevant. The table below provides an overview of the contents of each task in the benchmark.
            In summary, <strong>VideoGameQA-Benchmark</strong> contains 2,236 image-based samples and 1,200
            video-based
            samples sourced from more than 800 games and 9 synthetic game scenes.

        <h2>Parametric Clipping Detection</h2>
        <p>
            Given the common occurrence of clipping in games, our benchmark includes a dedicated task to evaluate a
            model's
            ability to detect such glitches. In this task, images feature an object (e.g., a cube, sphere, or character)
            positioned at varying distances from a human character — from far apart to fully overlapping/clipping. The
            VLM
            is asked whether it detects clipping across each of these distances.

        <h2>Bug Report Generation</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to testing and detection tasks, a potential application of VLMs is to assist QA engineers with
            writing reports for detected bugs. We simulate this task by asking the VLM to write a description of a
            glitch
            image that can be used in a bug report.

        <h2>Glitch Detection (Video)</h2>
        <p>
            Glitch detection in videos can be used to verify autonomous gameplay sessions from bots. Detecting glitches
            in
            videos is significantly more complex due to challenges such as analyzing motion patterns, and may require
            identifying transient glitches that appear only briefly in a few frames. We simulate this task by asking the
            vision-language model whether it detects a glitch in a video.

            In Clarity, I have provided container widths with five options: <code>main</code>, <code>large</code>,
            <code>extra-large</code>, <code>extra-extra-large</code>, and <code>max</code>. These container layouts are
            designed to be responsive, automatically adjusting based on the screen size. The default width is
            <code>main</code>, which is used for this blog post. Be cautious when using the <code>max</code> option, as
            it has zero padding. Unless you are certain of the design, it's always recommended to leave some space for
            visual aesthetic purposes.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Here is an example I designed, illustrating the architectural details in <a
                href="https://shikun.io/projects/prismer">Prismer</a> using the <code>extra-large</code> container

            Prismer has two main trainable components: the <b>Experts Resampler</b> that converts variable multi-task

            vision-language reasoning. To ensure that the model takes advantage of the rich domain-specific knowledge
            encoded in the pre-trained experts, the majority of network weights are frozen during training, as
            represented by the snowflake icon.

        <p class="text">
            In both visual diagram examples above, I used the <code>gray</code> option for the container to apply a
            subtle tint of gray, helping to distinguish it from the main container. This option is ideal for visual
            diagrams with a transparent background. For visual diagrams with a white background, I included the
            <code>gray-linear</code> option. This feature adds a tint of gray only to the edges of the container while
            keeping the center white, maintaining a clean and cohesive appearance while still providing distinct visual
            separation.
        </p>

        <h1>
            Design Features
        </h1>

        <p class="text">
            Here, I will briefly introduce each design feature included in the Clarity template.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Fundamentals
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
            In Clarity, I have selected <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins">Poppins</a> as the main
            sans-serif font and <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html">Charter</a> as the main serif
            font. Both fonts are freely distributed and without license restrictions. (Note that these two fonts differ
            from the licensed fonts used on my personal website.) All font sizes and weights are carefully tuned to be
            visually balanced and responsive across various screen sizes.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Additionally, a simple grid system is provided in a separate CSS file. This can be easily applied by using a
            div with class <code>columns-x</code> (e.g., <code>columns-6</code> for creating the above VSL example).
            This CSS file is designed to be separate from the main CSS file, allowing for project-specific
            customisations on top of the broadly used features included in the Clarity template.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Mathematics
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
            Clarity supports $\LaTeX$ using the <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> JavaScript engine. It can
            elegantly render simple inline mathematical equations such as $y=ax+b$, as well as more complex displayed
            equations such as used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">Variational Auto-Encoder (VAEs)</a>:
            $$
            L_{VAE}(x^{(i)}, \theta, \phi) = -\mathbb{E}_{z}\left[\log p_{\theta} \left(x^{(i)}|z\right) \right] +
            \text{KL}\left(q_\phi(z|x^{(i)}) \|\, p_\theta(z) \right).
            $$
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            I have chosen to use the <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/tex-gyre-pagella?lang=en">Gyre-Pagella</a> font for
            $\LaTeX$, which blends well with the current serif font, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing
            presentation of mathematical content.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Code
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
            Clarity supports inline code blocks such as <code>python train.py</code>, as well as display code blocks.
            The display code blocks also support syntax highlighting using the <a
                href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> library. Here is an example using Classifier-Free
            Guidance with Rescale implementation proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08891">this paper</a>.

        <pre><code class="python">def apply_cfg(pos, neg, weight=7.5, rescale=0.7):
    # Apply regular classifier-free guidance.
    cfg = neg + weight * (pos - neg)

    # Calculate standard deviations.
    std_pos = pos.std([1,2,3], keepdim=True)
    std_cfg = cfg.std([1,2,3], keepdim=True)

    # Apply guidance rescale with fused operations.
    factor = std_pos / std_cfg
    factor = rescale * factor + (1 - rescale)
    return cfg * factor</code></pre>
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The display code block can also used for bibliographies, such as:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="plaintext">@article{lecun2015deep,
    title={Deep learning},
    author={LeCun, Yann and Bengio, Yoshua and Hinton, Geoffrey},
    journal={nature},
    year={2015},
    publisher={Nature Publishing Group UK London}
}</code></pre>

        <p class="text">
            Clarity uses my personal favourite monospaced font: <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira
                Code</a> in code blocks. It also supports rendering beautifully coding literatures such as
            <code>--> ++ != ## <<>></code>.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Tables
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
            Clarity provides table blocks where every odd row is re-coloured with a gray tint. This helps to easily
            distinguish information within different rows, particularly with very wide tables. Here is an example using
            different model variants proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971">Llama-1</a>.

        <h2>
            Colour
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
            Colour is one of the most crucial visual elements in design and visualisation, and it is the main reason in
            making the <a href="https://www.theolympicdesign.com/olympic-games/the-look-of-the-games/paris-2024/">Paris
                Olympics 2024</a> such visually memorable and refreshing. While I'm not a colour expert, and there're
            always more to learn, I generally prefer using low-contrast, pastel-like colours in my designs. I typically
            use variants of gray and dark blue to represent common features, and employ warmer colours such as orange
            and red to highlight important design elements, as illustrated in the neural architecture design example
            from this blog post.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            For a more detailed understanding of colour design, I highly recommend the <a
                href="https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/overview">Material Design Colour Guidelines</a> and <a
                href="https://www.molecularecologist.com/2020/04/23/simple-tools-for-mastering-color-in-scientific-figures/">this

            Icons
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            In Clarity, all icons are integrated using <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a>. As one of the
            largest and most comprehensive icon libraries available, FontAwesome offers a vast collection of clean and
            minimalist icons that perfectly align with Clarity's design style and a wide range of use cases. I have
            found FontAwesome particularly valuable for many of my design projects, and its integration ensures that
            Clarity maintains a modern and consistent visual style throughout.

            <!-- I highly recommend purchasing the FontAwesome Pro version, as it offers a wider selection of icons and styles that integrate beautifully with this template. -->

            Data Plots and Visualisation
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
            I try to provide consistently high-quality plots useable for both $\LaTeX$ papers and websites using the <a
                href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package">TikZ</a> library. However, as many researchers
            know, TiKz offers stunning vector graphics but is notoriously difficult to use, and $\LaTeX$'s syntax design
            can be quite a headache (which makes new layout tools like <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a> quite
            intriguing).

        </p>

        <p class="text">
            To balance efficiency with quality, I typically use <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> and
            other Python tools to quickly prototype plots. I then use <a
                href="https://github.com/nschloe/tikzplotlib">tikzplotlib</a> to convert these plots into TiKz code.
            Finally, I refine the generated Tikz code for the final presentation. Although this process isn't always
            perfect, it has proven to be my most efficient solution, allowing me to create high-quality plots within a
            reasonable time (such as this example of raw TiKz code <a
                href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fsiz2il9yoiymk94v55v8/vqav2.tex?rlkey=9yb86m8aar91a8tijcgf6pq3w&dl=0">here</a>).

            Open-Source Contribution and Future Plans
        </h1>

        <p class="text">
            The current version of Clarity already includes a range of design features suitable for many use cases.
            However, I plan to continue improving Clarity with new features and design elements as long as I am still
            working in AI research (and/or AGI is not solved :/). Since Clarity is open-source, I also welcome
            contributions from the community. Some example features that would be valuable additions include: 1. A
            content menu and hover citation system similar to those found in <a
                href="https://distill.pub/2021/understanding-gnns/">Distill blogs</a>, and 2. Music and sound layouts as
            demonstrated in <a href="https://openai.com/index/jukebox/">OpenAI Jukebox</a>.

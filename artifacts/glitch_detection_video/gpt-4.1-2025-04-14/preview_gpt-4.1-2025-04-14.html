The player continues to attack the zombie, and it remains on the ground with the health bar still present, which is unusual as typically enemies should either get up and attack or be considered dead and have their health bar removed. Eventually, the zombie stands up again and resumes attacking, which suggests it was not actually dead. This behavior could be a result of a ragdoll or AI state glitch where the enemy is stuck in a &#x27;downed&#x27; animation while still being alive.&quot;,

At one point, the character&#x27;s limbs and torso are elongated and twisted, and the mesh appears to be stretched across the environment, which is not intended behavior. This is a clear example of a physics or collision glitch, commonly seen in games when ragdoll or object interactions go awry.&quot;,

There is no evidence of abnormal behavior such as blocks clipping through each other, getting stuck, or disappearing. The puzzle appears to be functioning as intended, with the blocks stacking and unstacking in response to player input.&quot;,

The car stops for a group of people, and there is a brief moment where an NPC is seen standing on top of a rock and another on top of the vehicle&#x27;s roll bar, which could be interpreted as odd NPC pathfinding. However, this is a common occurrence in many games and does not necessarily indicate a glitch, but rather a limitation of AI navigation.

This is consistent with the &#x27;kill cam&#x27; feature found in games like Sniper Elite, where the camera follows the bullet and shows its impact in detail. All visual effects, including the exaggerated ragdoll physics and gore, are intentional design choices for dramatic effect and not glitches.&quot;,

  &quot;reasoning&quot;: &quot;The sequence of images shows a player flying a helicopter, then suddenly being ejected from the vehicle and falling to the ground. The helicopter appears to have a broken window, which could indicate damage, but there is no visible explosion or clear cause for the ejection. In GTA Online, players are typically only ejected from aircraft if they are destroyed, if the player chooses to exit, or if there is a game glitch. The abrupt ejection without visible cause suggests a possible glitch, but it could also be a result of the player pressing the exit button. There is no clear evidence of a graphical or physics bug, just an unexpected ejection.&quot;,

  &quot;reasoning&quot;: &quot;The sequence of images shows a character riding a horse, approaching a wagon, and then mounting the wagon. The character then stands on top of the moving wagon, which is unusual but possible in some games. However, there is no evidence of abnormal physics, clipping, or unintended behavior in the character&#x27;s movement or interaction with the wagon. The character is later seen shooting at the driver and then falling off, which appears to be a normal consequence of the in-game actions.

The sequence shows the player character repeatedly positioned directly underneath or inside the boss&#x27;s body, with the camera clipping through the boss&#x27;s model. This is a common occurrence in many games with large enemies and third-person cameras, especially in FromSoftware titles. However, this is generally considered a camera or collision issue rather than a true gameplay glitch, as it does not appear to break the game, provide an unfair advantage, or cause unintended behavior in the boss fight. The boss and player both continue to function as expected.&quot;,

  &quot;reasoning&quot;: &quot;Throughout the sequence, Geralt (the player character) appears to be stuck in a crouched or &#x27;dodging&#x27; animation, sliding across the ground without returning to a normal standing or running posture. This is not typical behavior in The Witcher 3, where the character should return to a standing or running animation after dodging or rolling. Additionally, the message &#x27;You cannot do that now&#x27; repeatedly appears, suggesting the game is preventing certain actions, likely due to the character being stuck in an unintended state. This is further supported by the fact that Geralt is able to move and fight while in this glitched posture.&quot;,

In these images, Gwyndolin remains far ahead for an unusually long time, and the environment appears to repeat without any progression toward the boss.

  &quot;reasoning&quot;: &quot;In the provided sequence of images, the gameplay appears to be a typical fighting game scenario with special attacks, combos, and dramatic effects. However, in several frames, Blackbeard&#x27;s character model is seen in unnatural positions, such as being partially embedded in the ground or wall, and his limbs and body are contorted in ways that do not match normal animation or ragdoll physics. This suggests a collision or animation glitch where the character model is not interacting correctly with the environment or other characters.&quot;,

The minimap and visuals indicate that the boss, Lothar, follows the player to the edge.

The player is able to move freely in a small area at the edge of the arena, and Lothar does not attack or move closer, which is unusual for a boss AI.

Normally, zombies in games like this would react to the player&#x27;s presence, especially at such close range.

  &quot;reasoning&quot;: &quot;In the sequence of images, the player character appears to be fighting a boss enemy. At one point, the character is seen standing on top of the boss, which is a normal occurrence in some games. However, in the later frames, the character is launched extremely high into the air, far above the boss and the camera, which is not typical behavior for standard boss attacks or knockback effects. This suggests a physics or collision glitch, as the character&#x27;s trajectory and height are abnormal and not consistent with intended game mechanics.&quot;,
  &quot;glitch_detected&quot;: true,
  &quot;description_of_glitch&quot;: &quot;The player character is launched unnaturally high into the air, likely due to a physics or collision detection glitch during the boss fight. This results in the character being propelled far above the intended play area.&quot;

  &quot;reasoning&quot;: &quot;In the sequence of images, the character Erend&#x27;s facial hair changes dramatically between shots. In the first image, he has a full beard and mustache, but in the subsequent images, his facial hair changes to a different style, with the beard and mustache appearing trimmed or altered. This is not consistent with normal character animation and suggests a visual glitch or continuity error in the game&#x27;s cutscene rendering.&quot;,
  &quot;glitch_detected&quot;: true,
  &quot;description_of_glitch&quot;: &quot;Erend&#x27;s facial hair changes style abruptly between shots in the same conversation, indicating a rendering or continuity glitch.&quot;

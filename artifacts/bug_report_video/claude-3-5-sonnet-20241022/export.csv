The character model appears to be rapidly shifting positions and poses while maintaining the interaction marker.",NPC Animation Glitch During Dialogue Interaction,"During a dialogue interaction with Ashley Williams, the NPC's character model exhibits erratic animation behavior. The character rapidly shifts between different poses and positions while the dialogue interaction marker remains active. This creates an unnatural 'dancing' or 'jittering' effect that breaks immersion and appears unintentional. The glitch seems to persist throughout the entire dialogue sequence.","NPC Character Animation System, specifically during dialogue interactions","Ground-truth bug: the NPC remains in its default T/A-pose, does not play any locomotion animation, slides/floats when it should be walking (especially up stairs). Key characteristics: permanently frozen in one pose, legs not animated, sliding movement.

Generated report: the NPC ‘rapidly shifts between different poses’, creating a jittering/dancing effect during a dialogue scene. It is not stuck in a single T- or A-pose, nor does it describe sliding movement or leg inactivity; instead it describes continuous pose changes while the dialogue marker is active.

Because the symptoms (frozen T-pose and sliding locomotion vs. jittering pose changes during dialogue) and the context (general movement vs. dialogue interaction) are different, the two reports refer to different underlying bugs.",False

This likewise points to helicopter animation being frozen while it remains aloft, and mentions the character under/suspended from it.

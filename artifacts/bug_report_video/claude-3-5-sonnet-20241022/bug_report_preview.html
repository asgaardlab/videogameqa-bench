Key characteristics: permanently frozen in one pose, legs not animated, sliding movement.

Generated report: the NPC ‘rapidly shifts between different poses’, creating a jittering/dancing effect during a dialogue scene. It is not stuck in a single T- or A-pose, nor does it describe sliding movement or leg inactivity; instead it describes continuous pose changes while the dialogue marker is active.

Because the symptoms (frozen T-pose and sliding locomotion vs. jittering pose changes during dialogue) and the context (general movement vs. dialogue interaction) are different, the two reports refer to different underlying bugs.</pre></td>

Generated report: describes a helicopter extraction scene where both helicopter and the figure below are frozen in mid-air without expected movement, creating an unrealistic effect. This likewise points to helicopter animation being frozen while it remains aloft, and mentions the character under/suspended from it.
Both reports point to the same phenomenon: airborne helicopter appears static (no rotor/animation) with a stationary character beneath, indicating the same underlying animation freeze bug.

The generated report describes the visual result – a floating/disembodied head with mouth textures visible in the vehicle interior – which is the same visual symptom noted in the ground truth.  However, it never mentions the trigger condition of a second NPC already sitting in the driver’s seat. It talks only about viewing the character &quot;while seated in the driver’s seat&quot; and certain camera angles.  

Because the unique condition that distinguishes this bug (simultaneous occupancy/player entering an already-occupied seat) is absent from the generated report, we cannot be sure it is describing the same underlying issue; the symptom could stem from a general first-person camera clipping problem.  Thus the two descriptions are not guaranteed to be the same bug.</pre></td>

Generated report: Describes getting &quot;trapped in a repeating animation cycle&quot; while trying to move through a ventilation-shaft area.  The character &quot;slides or sticks to surfaces&quot; and animations don’t transition, producing jerky movement.  It says nothing about the door or vent refusing to open, and it does not single out vertical bouncing; instead it focuses on being stuck in a loop/slide.

Although both mention a ventilation context and weird movement, the concrete symptom and trigger differ: ground truth centers on an unopened door/vent followed by bouncing, whereas the generated report focuses on animation looping while traversing the shaft.  These could easily be two distinct bugs in the same area.

Therefore they should not be considered the same underlying issue.</pre></td>

Generated report: Describes a body bag/large object that entirely &quot;phases through&quot; a metal shutter or wall, indicating the collision does not stop the object at all. It is a complete failure of collision, not just visual clipping while being blocked.
Key differences: 
• Object type (enemy character vs inert body bag) is less important than the behavior.
• Behavior differs: Ground truth = blocked movement with partial visual clipping; Generated = no blocking, full passage through barrier.
Because the core symptom and severity of the collision issue differ, these reports are unlikely to be the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

• Generated report: while the character is grinding a rail, the model performs full-body rotations/inversions without losing contact, i.e., physically impossible poses.  
Key elements coincide: context is a rail-related skateboard trick, symptom is uncontrolled/physically impossible body rotations and twisted poses, and the cause is missing animation/physics constraints.

• Generated report: states that when an aircraft is destroyed the debris pattern is abnormal, artificial and not properly simulated.
The key defect in both is the lack of proper physics/geometry in the destruction animation (non-realistic debris behaviour). The mention of the water surface and upward projection in the ground truth is an extra detail, but it fits within the broader problem the generated report describes.

Key characteristics: (1) wrong creature – a horse, (2) levitates, (3) continues moving quickly.
Generated report: a dragon hangs motionless in the sky; the problem is that its flight animation is missing so it remains frozen.  Key characteristics: (1) different creature – a dragon, (2) levitates, but (3) is completely static (no movement), with focus on missing wing/flap animation rather than erratic movement.
Although both involve an entity above ground, the symptoms differ (static vs fast movement) and involve distinct assets (horse vs dragon). They likely stem from different animation/physics problems. Therefore they should be considered different bugs.</pre></td>

• Ground truth: the player simply hangs in mid-air for a couple of seconds and then falls – no mention of abilities, walls, rotating, or animation problems.
• Generated report: the issue only happens when executing a leap attack next to a vertical surface. The character hovers against the wall, keeps rotating, the attack animation never completes, and there is no indication the character automatically drops after a short time.
Because the trigger (leap attack vs. any normal situation), the visual behaviour (continuous rotation vs. brief freeze) and the duration/outcome (possibly stuck indefinitely vs. falls after a few seconds) are different, these are likely separate bugs.</pre></td>

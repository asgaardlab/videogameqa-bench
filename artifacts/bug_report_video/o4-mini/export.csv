Instead of stepping, she hovers above the steps with her arms outstretched and legs fully extended, sliding upward in place. This occurs repeatedly, preventing normal movement and blocking conversation prompts (‘Talk’). It appears to be a collision or navmesh issue on the staircase geometry that fails to trigger the proper walking or stair-climbing animations. The glitch breaks immersion and could prevent mission progression if the NPC cannot be correctly positioned.",Companion AI animation / physics (Ashley Williams),"Both descriptions talk about an NPC that, instead of playing the proper walking/stair-climbing animation, is frozen in a T-pose (or very similar arms-out stretched pose) and slides/hovers up stairs while its legs do not animate correctly. The generated report’s details (Ashley hovers above steps with arms outstretched, legs extended, repeatedly sliding upward) directly align with the ground truth symptoms (NPC stuck in T/A-pose, floats slightly, slides up stairs across ground, legs not functioning). The context (ascending stairs) and consequence (improper animation, floating movement) are the same. No significant differences suggest a different root cause or scenario.",True

This indicates the rope/hook physics or the NPC extraction animation has failed to attach and update correctly.",NPC Stuck Under Helicopter Without Extraction Rope,"When calling in a helicopter extraction, the downed NPC spawns immediately beneath the aircraft but no rope or tether is visible. The character’s ragdoll is locked in place, hovering in mid-air and failing to be hoisted upward. After several seconds, the NPC teleports downward and the ragdoll begins a broken fall animation. This breaks immersion, prevents proper extraction, and may interfere with mission progression if the extraction can’t complete.",NI C/Physics (extraction rope and NPC animation),"The ground-truth bug is that a helicopter is inexplicably flying even though its rotor blades are completely motionless. The key symptom is the visually incorrect, non-spinning rotors while the helicopter is airborne.

The main problem is the missing rope and NPC animation issues, not the rotor blades. There is no mention of rotor motion, helicopter flight dynamics, or anything related to rotor animation.

The door geometry remains solid yet entirely ignores the ragdoll, causing the guard to pass straight through walls and fixtures.",Enemy ragdoll clips through broken glass door and shelving,"When performing a takedown on the guard inside the curved glass entrance, the physics engine fails to register collisions between the ragdolled enemy and the door or shelf geometry. Instead of bouncing off or snagging on the broken glass frame, the corpse penetrates the door frame and shelving, traveling into the adjacent room. This results in unrealistic physics, visual pop-through of mesh geometry, and can break immersion when bodies occupy otherwise solid volumes.",physics,"Ground truth bug: After the enemy is attacked it freezes, then its body becomes distorted, limbs spin/shake rapidly, and it hovers – a physics instability causing violent spinning animation.
Generated bug: Enemy ragdoll passes through door/shelf geometry after takedown; collision not registered, resulting in clipping but no freezing, distortion, or spinning.
Symptoms, visual result, and trigger conditions differ; only commonality is that both concern physics, but the specific behavior is not the same. Therefore, they do not describe the same underlying bug.",False

The collisions, rotation speed, and final resting orientation all deviate from expected physics behavior.",Erratic enemy ragdoll launch and collision,"When the player defeats an enemy during the ‘Defend Yourself’ tutorial, the opponent’s ragdoll is catapulted with excessive velocity and angular momentum. The character model spins rapidly in midair, clips through the ground plane, lands on a parked vehicle’s roof, and slides across it before awkwardly landing back on the pavement. This produces visual breakage, inconsistent collision responses, and may allow the enemy to bypass intended hitboxes or remain in an invulnerable state.",ragdoll physics system,"The ground-truth bug is that, after being hit, the NPC first drops to the ground but then stays suspended a short distance above the ground while continually rotating – a hovering / levitation problem.

The generated report describes a different behaviour: the ragdoll is ‘catapulted’ with very high velocity, flies through the air, clips through the ground, lands on a car roof, then eventually falls back to the pavement. This is a launch/impulse problem, not a stationary hover. Although both descriptions involve ragdoll physics and rotation, the core symptom (hovering in place versus being hurled away and eventually landing) and the visual result (persistent floating) differ. Therefore they do not refer to the same underlying bug.",False

Rather than generating individual fragments with physics-driven trajectories, the engine spawns repeated slices of the car’s mesh that overlap and remain glued together. These artifacts clip through the barrier and each other, produce a distracting visual pileup, and can cause frame rate drops. The issue appears tied to the debris instancing or collision response under high-impact forces.",vehicle collision debris mesh,"Both reports concern visual artifacts that appear after a car crashes, but the specific behavior differs.  
• Ground truth: after impact, many black, shard-like fragments are suddenly propelled into the air (flying debris).  
• Generated report: after impact, duplicated slices of the car’s mesh stay overlapped at the collision point, clipping through objects and piling up; no mention of them being hurled upward, and colour/appearance is of duplicated mesh, not generic black shards.  
Because the nature of the artifact (flying shards vs stationary overlapping meshes) and its visual manifestation are different, they likely describe separate bugs even though both are triggered by a crash event.",False

Key symptom is a temporary suspension in the air (player stuck).

Generated report: concerns the Leap-Attack targeting system. The attack UI marker remains above a bird that has flown away; the player can still execute the dive attack, which misses and makes the character fall. There is no mention of the character hanging motionless in the air; the issue is about an incorrect target indicator and an attack being allowed on an invalid target.

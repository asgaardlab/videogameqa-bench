There is no visible rope, cable, or harness connecting the character to the helicopter, and the character&#x27;s position and animation do not change as the helicopter moves. This breaks immersion and may confuse players, as it appears the character is levitating or stuck in a T-pose-like state.

The key symptom is the motionless rotor while the helicopter still flies. 

Generated report instead focuses on an NPC floating below the helicopter with no visible attachment. It does not mention the rotor blades at all. The core problem it highlights is a missing attachment/animation for the NPC, not the helicopter’s rotor state.

Because the two descriptions point to different primary symptoms and likely different underlying systems (rotor animation vs. character attachment), they do not describe the same bug.</pre></td>

The generated report focuses solely on an attachment/animation error (character outside the helicopter) and makes no reference to rotor behaviour or oscillation. These missing details are central to the ground-truth description and could point to a different root cause (e.g., a full physics freeze of the helicopter rather than just an attachment issue). Because the generated report captures only part of the scenario and omits the unique rotor-stopped behaviour, it is unlikely to be describing the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

Generated report: character gets stuck on the ship’s edge (implies hanging/immobilised on ship side due to bad collision) and then falls through/into the water. This describes the same collision failure that first leaves the player hanging and subsequently makes them drop. 
Additional details in the generated report (&quot;falls through geometry&quot;, &quot;graphical artifacts&quot;) are extra observations but do not contradict the core behaviour. Both reports involve:
• Action: boarding / being on another ship
• Symptom: character becomes stuck/floating on the ship’s side/edge
• Result: eventually falls into the water.

Issue (2) says large sections of the construction area do not render at all; the player falls through the world or hits invisible walls – this is about missing geometry/rendering rather than the player forcing their way into an existing wall and causing camera clipping.

Generated report: describes an NPC that, after being hit by the player, stands motionless for a moment, then suddenly drops to knees and collapses stiffly, complaining about lack of rag-doll.
The key behaviour – delayed reaction followed by abrupt knee-drop/collapse – is identical. Although the generated report does not explicitly mention the ‘back-stab’ context or the player clipping into the NPC, it is still describing the same underlying animation timing/desynchronisation bug affecting the NPC’s death reaction.

Key elements that align:
• Character is moving but animation is missing/incorrect (sliding effect).

Difference:
• Ground truth mentions normal walking; generated report mentions crouched pose. This is a variation of the same fundamental problem (locomotion animation not triggered) and likely the same root cause.

Both descriptions identify the same core fault: the delivery truck does not properly align with the ground when entering the building/garage area, resulting in partial levitation and geometry clipping.

Generated report: NPC becomes stuck floating above a bridge during a cut-scene; the model is described as &quot;stuck in mid-air&quot; in an &quot;unnatural pose&quot; and does not move or walk away. The emphasis is on the NPC being frozen/hanging in place, not on repeated bouncing or vertical oscillation.

Although both issues involve an NPC positioned incorrectly in the air, the specific observed behavior is different: one is a continuous bouncing motion, the other is a stationary floating pose. These are likely distinct bugs with different manifestations and possibly different causes (animation jitter vs. failure to update position at all).

• Ground truth: the live (or freshly destroyed) jet becomes attached to the pole and continuously rotates around it – a dynamic, spinning motion bug.
• Generated report: the jet wreckage simply stays frozen, floating and intersecting the pole – a static positioning bug with no rotation mentioned.
Because the central anomalous behaviour (continuous rotation vs. static floating) is different, they likely stem from different physics issues even though they share similar scenery elements (jet + pole). Therefore they should be treated as separate bugs.</pre></td>

Generated report: After player kills enemy NPC with melee attack, ragdoll falls then partially or fully sinks/clips into terrain, body may become embedded, making looting difficult.

There is no visible rope, cable, or harness connecting the character to the helicopter, and the character's position and animation do not change as the helicopter moves.

The issue likely stems from a missing or broken attachment or animation for helicopter rappelling or extraction.",Character (enemy NPC) and helicopter (animation/attachment system),"Ground truth focuses on the helicopter being in flight even though its rotor blades are not turning; the presence of a character underneath is secondary context. The key symptom is the motionless rotor while the helicopter still flies.

The bug appears to be related to incorrect character attachment or animation syncing with the vehicle.",Character and vehicle (helicopter) interaction/physics,"Both descriptions mention a character standing on top of a helicopter that is supposedly in flight, but the ground-truth bug contains two additional, very distinctive symptoms that are absent from (and not implied by) the generated report: (1) the character is rapidly oscillating up and down, and (2) the helicopter’s rotor blades are completely motionless even though the craft is hovering. The generated report focuses solely on an attachment/animation error (character outside the helicopter) and makes no reference to rotor behaviour or oscillation. These missing details are central to the ground-truth description and could point to a different root cause (e.g., a full physics freeze of the helicopter rather than just an attachment issue).

This behavior breaks immersion and may make it difficult for players to loot the animal, impacting gameplay progression and realism.",Physics (animal ragdoll/collision response),"Both descriptions identify the same abnormal behavior: after being hit by an arrow, a deer (animal) is propelled upward into the air instead of exhibiting normal death or stagger animation.

The 'Leap Attack' mechanic appears to have targeted an airborne enemy in an unreachable position, causing the character to perform an unrealistic and unintended jump/fall.","Leap Attack Targets Unreachable Airborne Enemy, Causing Unintended Fall","When attempting a 'Leap Attack' on a bird flying in mid-air, the player character targets the bird and launches themselves off a cliff, resulting in a long fall and taking damage upon landing. The attack does not connect with the bird, and the character's trajectory is not physically plausible. This behavior can lead to player frustration, unnecessary health loss, and breaks immersion due to the unrealistic movement and targeting logic.","Character movement/attack targeting system, enemy AI (bird), physics","Ground truth bug: player becomes suspended in mid-air for a few seconds before gravity resumes. Key symptom: temporary hovering/stuck state.
Generated report: during a Leap Attack on an airborne enemy the character launches off a cliff, misses the target, then falls a long distance and takes damage. The character is not described as frozen or hovering; the problem is incorrect targeting and an unrealistic jump, not a mid-air stall.
Because the core behavior, trigger, and symptoms differ, the two reports do not describe the same underlying issue.",False

These pieces do not resemble realistic wood or boat fragments, but instead look like glitched, white, cloth-like polygons. This is not consistent with expected destruction physics or debris rendering.",Distorted and Glitched Boat Debris Textures After Destruction,"When the small boat is destroyed, the resulting debris floating on the water displays severe graphical anomalies. The debris appears as stretched, white, cloth-like polygons rather than realistic wooden fragments. This visual bug breaks immersion and may confuse players, as the debris does not match the expected appearance of destroyed boat parts.",Boat destruction debris (environment/physics/rendering),"The ground truth bug concerns unexpected boat behavior: it suddenly accelerates and crashes/explodes without cause. The generated report talks about a purely graphical issue where the debris textures after boat destruction are distorted. The symptoms, affected aspect (physics/gameplay vs. rendering), and player impact are completely different. Therefore they do not describe the same bug.",False
f2d8efa1-39b9-4d43-8ceb-dd5903cc3815,gpt-4.1-2025-04-14,"In the sequence of images, an enemy NPC is seen climbing through a window. In the fifth image, the NPC appears to be stuck in an unnatural pose, with one leg over the window ledge and the other still inside, while being shot. In the subsequent images, the NPC is no longer visible, suggesting they may have disappeared or fallen in an unrealistic manner. This behavior is inconsistent with expected ragdoll or death animations, indicating a possible glitch in the NPC's transition or death state.",NPC Gets Stuck and Disappears When Shot While Climbing Through Window,"When an enemy NPC is shot while climbing through a window, the character model becomes stuck in an unnatural pose, with one leg over the window ledge and the other inside the building. After being shot, the NPC abruptly disappears or falls in an unrealistic manner, rather than playing a proper ragdoll or death animation. This disrupts immersion and may impact gameplay by making it unclear if the NPC has been neutralized or if their body can be interacted with.",NPC character model and animation system,"Both descriptions concern the exact same circumstance and outcome: an NPC is in the middle of climbing through a window when the player shoots them, and instead of showing a normal death/ragdoll animation the NPC vanishes. The generated report mentions the NPC getting momentarily stuck in an odd pose before disappearing or falling, but the key symptoms (state: climbing through window; trigger: being shot; result: disappearance instead of proper animation) align perfectly with the ground-truth bug. There are no conflicting details that would suggest a different issue.",True

This is not a typical display for vehicle selection, where the car should be presented in a neutral, unobstructed environment. The car's collision with the wall and its awkward placement suggest a rendering or asset loading issue.",Vehicle Model Clipping into Wall During Selection Screen,"During the vehicle selection phase of the race, the selected car (Karin Sultan RS) is displayed stuck and partially clipped into a wall or prop. This visual bug causes the car to appear in an unrealistic and unintended position, which may confuse players or detract from the user experience. The issue does not impact gameplay directly but affects the presentation and immersion of the selection interface.",Vehicle model display in the selection UI,"Ground truth: in-game situation where a car is lodged inside a large wind-turbine blade out in the world. Generated report: car model shown in vehicle-selection UI is partly inside a wall/prop. Although both involve visual clipping of a car, they occur in completely different contexts (world environment vs. menu scene) and with different geometry (wind-turbine blade vs. generic wall/prop). These are treated as separate bugs with different triggers and likely different fixes.",False

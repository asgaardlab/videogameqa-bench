The presence of a character beneath the helicopter is incidental; the core issue is the motionless rotor while flying.

The generated report focuses on the character being suspended in mid-air from the helicopter without any rope or cable. It does not mention the rotor blades being motionless or any problem with the helicopter’s ability to fly. Instead, it frames the bug as a physics issue with the character, not an animation/physics issue with the helicopter rotor.

Because the primary symptom and root cause described differ (motionless rotor vs. unsupported hanging character), the two reports do not refer to the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

The generated report, however, claims a physics bug: the arrows are embedded in the bird’s body yet the bird remains unaffected, calling this a “physics anomaly.” The presence of embedded arrows and the assertion that the bird should be impeded are key parts of the generated report but are absent from the ground truth. Conversely, the ground truth’s mention of multiple birds and arrows merely being around (not embedded) is not reflected in the generated report.

Because the core issue (a physics glitch with embedded arrows) described in the generated report is not present in the ground truth description, the two are not describing the same bug or even necessarily a bug at all.</pre></td>

Generated report: on collision, normal car components (tyres, body panels) break off and then remain suspended/floating in mid-air. It describes legitimate car parts detaching and staying in the air rather than many black shards being explosively thrown upward.

Although both happen after a collision, the nature of the unintended objects is different (graphical black shards vs actual car parts), and the generated report emphasises the parts floating rather than being suddenly launched.

Generated report instead says: (a) webbing does not securely hold an attached object, indicating a physics anomaly, and (b) the player character’s (Spider-Man’s) own movement/positioning looks unnatural. It does not mention enemies clipping through geometry, twisted limbs, or being projected inside vehicles. The focus is on web strength and Spider-Man animation, not on enemy clipping/deformation.

Because the described symptoms, actors affected, and nature of the anomaly differ, the two reports do not refer to the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

Generated report: describes a (unspecified) character stuck on TOP of a vehicle that is driving across a bridge. There is no mention that the vehicle is overturned, nor that the character is the driver; the position is on top rather than beside. It may sound like a general “character offset from vehicle” issue, but the concrete circumstances differ from the ground-truth scenario that explicitly involves an overturned jeep and the driver next to it.
Because the triggering condition (overturned jeep) and the exact incorrect position (floating beside vs. on top) are different, we cannot be sure they refer to the same underlying bug. Therefore they should be treated as different reports.</pre></td>

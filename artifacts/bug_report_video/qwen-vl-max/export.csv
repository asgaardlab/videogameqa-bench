This suggests a physics anomaly or a glitch in the game.",Character Suspended Mid-Air from Helicopter,"In the video, a character is seen hanging from a helicopter while the helicopter hovers in the sky. The character remains suspended in mid-air without any visible means of support, such as a rope or cable. This behavior is inconsistent with realistic physics and could potentially impact gameplay by causing confusion or unexpected interactions with other game elements.",Character,"Ground truth bug is about a helicopter that can stay airborne even though its rotor blades are not spinning. The presence of a character beneath the helicopter is incidental; the core issue is the motionless rotor while flying.

The generated report focuses on the character being suspended in mid-air from the helicopter without any rope or cable. It does not mention the rotor blades being motionless or any problem with the helicopter’s ability to fly. Instead, it frames the bug as a physics issue with the character, not an animation/physics issue with the helicopter rotor.

This visual glitch disrupts the realism of the scene and could potentially interfere with gameplay mechanics related to vehicle interaction and player movement.",Character,"Both descriptions talk about the same unexpected situation in which a player character is located on top of a helicopter during flight rather than being in a normal attachment position.  The ground-truth text adds extra observations (the character bobs up and down and the rotor blades are motionless), but those details are not contradicted by the generated report; they are simply omitted.  Nothing in the generated report introduces a different cause or symptom that would indicate a separate bug.  Therefore the two reports refer to the same underlying issue of improper character placement/interaction with the helicopter.",True

This indicates a desynchronization glitch where the character's position does not match the expected location within the game world. This can disrupt gameplay and potentially cause the player to lose progress or become stuck.,Character,"The ground-truth bug is a very specific collision problem: after leaping onto another ship the avatar becomes frozen in mid-air beside the hull, keeps the falling animation, and after a short time drops into the water.  There is no mention of any on-screen error or desynchronization message.

The generated report instead speaks about a general ""desynchronization"" state in which the character is floating in the air with the ""Desynchronizacja"" warning, implying the game has detected a position/logic mismatch. It does not mention ships, jumping, being pinned to the ship’s side, continuous falling animation, or the subsequent fall into the water.

Key points: helicopter emerges from ground (coming up), sudden, causes player death.
Generated report: Helicopter is sitting on the ground with rotors spinning; described as being “grounded” or stuck on the ground, possibly should be flying. No mention of emerging from beneath terrain or killing player.
The symptoms and circumstances differ: one is about emergence from underground and lethal collision; the other is about being stuck on the surface. They are not the same underlying bug.",False

This behavior is unusual and suggests a potential physics anomaly or collision detection issue.",Horse Encounters Invisible Barrier,"The horse in the video walks towards a fence and then abruptly stops, as if it has encountered an invisible barrier. This behavior is unexpected and disrupts the natural movement of the horse. The player may experience difficulty in controlling the horse's movement and navigating through the environment.",Character (horse),"Ground truth bug: horse is stationary but repeatedly moves up and down in place (vertical oscillation). Generated report: horse walks toward a fence and stops due to an invisible barrier, blocking forward movement. Issues involve different behaviors (vertical bouncing vs. forward movement obstruction) and different conditions (standing still vs. collision with fence). Therefore they are not the same bug.",False

The character's movement and positioning seem unnatural and inconsistent with the expected behavior in the game.",Character Model Clipping Through Environment,Donny Kowalski's character model is observed clipping through various objects and other characters in the environment. This results in the character appearing partially embedded in surfaces or floating unnaturally. This glitch affects the immersion and could potentially impact gameplay by causing unexpected interactions or making it difficult to predict the character's movements.,Character,"Ground truth bug: when the boy enters red robotic armor, his model is replaced by an incorrect large naked headless model (wrong model/appearance after transformation). Generated report: model clipping through objects, embedded/floating—focus on collision/physics, not transformation or wrong model. Symptoms, conditions, and impact differ. Therefore they do not describe same bug.",False

There are no apparent graphical bugs, rendering issues, physics anomalies, or unexpected events observed in the sequence of frames provided.",No Glitches Observed,"The video clip depicts normal gameplay behavior with the player navigating through the environment and engaging in combat. The enemy is correctly killed, and there are no visual glitches or anomalies affecting the gameplay experience.",None,"The ground truth describes a bug where shooting an enemy causes them to be launched unrealistically into the air. The generated report explicitly states that no glitches or anomalies were observed and that gameplay is normal. It therefore denies the existence of the described issue.

In one scene, the character appears to be webbing an object or person to a pole. However, the physics of the webbing and the interaction with the environment seem inconsistent, as the webbed object does not appear to be securely attached or restrained. Additionally, there is a moment where the character's movement and positioning look unnatural, suggesting a potential glitch in the animation or physics engine.",Webbing Physics Anomaly and Character Movement Glitch,"During the sequence, the character uses webbing to attach an object to a pole. However, the webbing does not appear to securely hold the object, indicating a physics anomaly. Furthermore, at one point, the character's movement and positioning look unnatural, suggesting a glitch in the animation or physics engine. This could affect gameplay by making it difficult to rely on webbing mechanics and potentially causing immersion-breaking moments.","Character (Spider-Man), Webbing Mechanics, Environment Interaction","Ground truth bug concerns enemies: (1) an enemy caught in a web clips through a lamppost, (2) another enemy’s legs are unnaturally twisted, (3) a different enemy is launched into a truck and clips/moves inside it. All issues involve enemy models clipping or deforming after web/attack interactions.

Generated report instead says: (a) webbing does not securely hold an attached object, indicating a physics anomaly, and (b) the player character’s (Spider-Man’s) own movement/positioning looks unnatural. It does not mention enemies clipping through geometry, twisted limbs, or being projected inside vehicles. The focus is on web strength and Spider-Man animation, not on enemy clipping/deformation.

Because the described symptoms, actors affected, and nature of the anomaly differ, the two reports do not refer to the same underlying bug.",False
183b69e8-a1f6-49f5-89f8-b4af95ca4995,qwen-vl-max,The video clip shows a character who appears to be stuck or glitched on top of a vehicle. This is unusual because characters are typically not meant to be positioned in this manner. The character's position and the fact that they remain there while the vehicle moves suggest a physics anomaly or a bug in the game.,Character Stuck on Top of Vehicle,"The character is seen stuck on top of a vehicle, which is moving across a bridge. This behavior is unexpected as characters should not be able to occupy such positions on vehicles. The character remains in this position even as the vehicle continues to move, indicating a potential issue with the game's physics engine or collision detection.",Character,"Ground truth: specific to the driver of an overturned jeep – the driver is offset and floating next to the overturned vehicle, staying in that wrong pose when the jeep later moves. Key points are (1) it is the official driver/occupant, (2) the vehicle is overturned, (3) the character is beside the vehicle, not on top.
Generated report: describes a (unspecified) character stuck on TOP of a vehicle that is driving across a bridge. There is no mention that the vehicle is overturned, nor that the character is the driver; the position is on top rather than beside. It may sound like a general “character offset from vehicle” issue, but the concrete circumstances differ from the ground-truth scenario that explicitly involves an overturned jeep and the driver next to it.
Because the triggering condition (overturned jeep) and the exact incorrect position (floating beside vs. on top) are different, we cannot be sure they refer to the same underlying bug. Therefore they should be treated as different reports.",False

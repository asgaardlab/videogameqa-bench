The essential symptom is that the character never plays a walk/run animation at all – it stays in the reference pose, floats slightly and slides up stairs/along the ground.

The generated report mentions the NPC floating and sliding on a staircase with jerky, unnatural movement and legs not contacting the stairs, but it never says the character is locked in a T-pose/A-pose or otherwise remaining in the reference pose. It simply describes a bad locomotion animation. Characters can slide or float because of foot-placement/IK issues without being stuck in a T-pose.

Because the distinctive T-pose/A-pose condition that defines the ground-truth bug is missing from the generated report, the two reports could describe different underlying issues even though both involve sliding movement. Therefore they do not clearly refer to the same bug.</pre></td>

Generated bug: focuses on the character being suspended under the helicopter with no rope/harness, i.e., improper attachment or physics for the character. It does not mention the rotor blades or the helicopter’s ability to fly while rotors are motionless.

Because the generated report and ground truth center on different visual/physics problems (character suspension vs. rotor not spinning) they do not describe the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

The frozen rotor blades are an essential part of the described defect.

The generated report only mentions the player being able to stand on the exterior of a flying helicopter (a collision/physics issue). It does not mention the helicopter’s rotor blades being motionless, nor the oscillating movement. Therefore it captures only part of the scene and omits the key animation/physics error concerning the rotor. Because it fails to describe the same full malfunction and could easily be a different bug (simply standing on vehicles), the two reports should not be considered the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

It is framed as a rendering/texture-mapping error on the mirror, not as a camera-clipping issue caused by two characters occupying the same seat.

Because the trigger, location, and explanation differ (mirror texture bug vs. camera clipping with NPC driver), these two reports do not address the same underlying bug even though both mention a disembodied mouth inside a vehicle.</pre></td>

The generated report talks about a much broader situation – any weapon attack – where the NPC shows no immediate hit reaction and, when it collapses, its ragdoll sinks through the sidewalk or other scenery.

Generated report describes the same two situations at a slightly higher level: (1) “two enemies caught in Spider-Man’s web become stuck in an overlapping and intersecting position, with their models visibly tangled and intersecting unnaturally” – this captures the visual/webbed enemies deformation/clipping problem noted in the ground truth (although it says they intersect each other rather than a lamp-post, it is still the same bug of webbed enemies being improperly positioned/clipped).  (2) “enemies inside the truck are clipping through the truck&#x27;s walls” directly matches the ground-truth description of an enemy launched into a truck and clipping inside it.  

Both reports therefore point to the same underlying defects: collision/clipping issues for web-trapped enemies and for an enemy inside the truck after a hit.

Generated report: Describes a motorcycle that &quot;unexpectedly launches into the air with an exaggerated height and distance&quot; and keeps travelling, attributing it to physics/collision problems.  
Both reports describe the same core symptom: a motorcycle goes airborne far higher than intended and continues moving, which is an unrealistic physics behaviour.  Differences in wording (&quot;levitates&quot; vs &quot;launches&quot;, no explicit mention that it was to the player’s right) do not indicate a different bug; both point to an unintended, sustained airborne state of the motorcycle during normal riding.

Generated report: A character (here referred to as the player character) gets stuck on a vehicle roof/rear; limbs clip and stretch unnaturally while the vehicle moves, and the character stays attached.

Key points comparison:
• Both involve a character positioned on the roof (or roof/rear) of a vehicle.
• Both describe severe mesh/limb distortion (stretching/clipping) linked to the vehicle’s motion.
• Both imply the distortion persists or worsens while the vehicle is in motion.

Differences (NPC vs player, mention of inability to dismount): these are secondary. They do not change the core bug of a character model becoming distorted when on top of a moving vehicle. Therefore they describe the same underlying issue.</pre></td>

Generated: driving up a ramp (specific location near Algonquin Bridge), vehicle clips through barrier/building, flips and becomes stuck in unnatural position (implying immobilized, likely vertical or partially inside building). Both describe a physics/collision issue triggered by a ramp, leading to the car becoming lodged against/inside a building and immobile, requiring reset.

Generated report: describes that while the player is riding a horse &quot;near a horse-drawn carriage,&quot; the player is &quot;suddenly and unexpectedly thrown off the horse,&quot; producing odd fall animation. It captures the same situation: player on horse, carriage present, sudden ejection from horse.

Generated report: NPC floats above ground, then falls, and body parts separate on impact – ragdoll parts scatter. No mention of clipping through terrain or disappearing; issue is with ragdoll disassembly and floating, not falling through ground.
Since the symptoms and affected system differ (ragdoll breakup vs terrain clipping), they are not the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

Ground truth: After the player’s car hits an obstacle, black shard-like particles are launched into the air. The shards are described as separate fragments, not as part of any vehicle model, and there is no mention of deformation or stretching of the cars themselves.

Generated report: When the player’s car hits a wall, the OPPONENT car’s entire model breaks apart and its mesh is stretched/distorted. The emphasis is on the opponent car’s model integrity failing (mesh fragmentation), not on independent black shards being flung into the air.

Because one bug concerns stray black particles while the other concerns a car model’s mesh collapsing, they likely refer to different issues even though both are triggered by a collision and involve “fragments.” Therefore they should not be considered the same bug.</pre></td>

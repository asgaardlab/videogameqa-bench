This behavior suggests a physics or animation glitch causing the character to move in an unintended manner.",Character Ashley Williams exhibits floating and sliding animation glitch on stairs,"Ashley Williams, a companion character, is observed floating and sliding sideways up a staircase instead of walking normally. The character's legs do not appear to be making proper contact with the stairs, and the movement is jerky and unnatural. This glitch could disrupt immersion and potentially interfere with gameplay if the character is required to follow or interact in this area.",Character animation and physics,"The ground-truth bug is specifically about an NPC that is frozen in a T- or A-pose (reference pose: arms out, no normal body animation) while it moves. The essential symptom is that the character never plays a walk/run animation at all – it stays in the reference pose, floats slightly and slides up stairs/along the ground.

The generated report mentions the NPC floating and sliding on a staircase with jerky, unnatural movement and legs not contacting the stairs, but it never says the character is locked in a T-pose/A-pose or otherwise remaining in the reference pose. It simply describes a bad locomotion animation. Characters can slide or float because of foot-placement/IK issues without being stuck in a T-pose.

Because the distinctive T-pose/A-pose condition that defines the ground-truth bug is missing from the generated report, the two reports could describe different underlying issues even though both involve sliding movement. Therefore they do not clearly refer to the same bug.",False

The character's position does not change relative to the helicopter, and there is no rope or harness visible, indicating a physics or animation bug.

The frozen rotor blades are an essential part of the described defect.

The generated report only mentions the player being able to stand on the exterior of a flying helicopter (a collision/physics issue). It does not mention the helicopter’s rotor blades being motionless, nor the oscillating movement. Therefore it captures only part of the scene and omits the key animation/physics error concerning the rotor. Because it fails to describe the same full malfunction and could easily be a different bug (simply standing on vehicles), the two reports should not be considered the same underlying bug.",False

The generated report, however, describes a helicopter that becomes lodged in terrain, immobilising the vehicle and trapping the player.

Generated report: when trying to climb/jump on ship edge, the character immediately clips through the ship’s geometry and falls straight into the water, causing desync. No mention of being suspended or stuck in air; instead it describes passing through the ship interior.

These are different visual/physics problems that occur at different moments (mid-air vs. landing) and have different observable effects. Because the core behaviors do not align, they refer to different bugs.",False
542a7d9d-6881-418e-95e7-88053cdc8245,gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14,"The video shows a character rowing a boat on water, but suddenly the boat breaks apart into pieces and the character falls into the water. The debris from the boat remains floating unnaturally on the water surface, which is not typical behavior for a boat in a game. This indicates a physics or collision detection glitch where the boat's destruction and debris handling are not functioning correctly.",Boat breaks apart unexpectedly and debris floats unnaturally on water,"While navigating the boat, it suddenly breaks apart into multiple pieces without any visible cause such as collision or damage. The character falls into the water, and the boat debris remains floating on the water surface in an unrealistic manner. This glitch disrupts gameplay immersion and may prevent normal boat usage or progression in water-based sections.",Physics and object destruction of the boat,"Both descriptions revolve around the same core symptom: the boat is destroyed without any external trigger such as a collision or visible damage. In the ground-truth this appears as the boat suddenly speeding up and then crashing/exploding, while in the generated report it appears as the boat instantly breaking apart. Despite the extra detail about debris floating and the omission of the brief speed-up phase, the underlying defect being reported is identical—unexpected spontaneous destruction of the boat during normal navigation.",True
f2d8efa1-39b9-4d43-8ceb-dd5903cc3815,gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14,"The character model is seen crouching and moving through an indoor environment, but the lighting and shadows on the character and environment appear inconsistent. The reflections on the floor are overly bright and do not correspond well with the lighting in the room. Additionally, the character's helmet has an unusual shine that looks out of place compared to the rest of the scene. There is also a slight clipping issue where the character's hand or weapon intersects with the environment in an unnatural way.",Inconsistent lighting and reflection rendering with minor clipping on character model,"The indoor environment shows overly bright and unrealistic reflections on the floor that do not match the ambient lighting, causing a visual inconsistency. The character's helmet has an exaggerated shine that stands out unnaturally. Furthermore, the character's hand or weapon clips slightly through nearby objects during movement, breaking immersion. These issues can distract players and reduce visual fidelity during gameplay.",Character model and environment lighting/reflections,"Ground truth bug concerns an NPC disappearing (vanishing) after being shot while climbing through a window. The generated report talks about lighting/reflection issues, shiny helmet, and minor clipping of hand/weapon. It does not mention NPC disappearance, shooting, or climbing through a window. Conversely, ground truth does not discuss lighting or clipping. Therefore they describe different issues.",False

This is an unusual visual overlap that suggests a rendering or clipping issue. The vehicle appears to be embedded inside the turbine blades, which is not expected behavior in a vehicle selection screen and could confuse players or indicate a problem with the environment or object placement.",Vehicle Model Clipping Through Wind Turbine Blades in Vehicle Selection Screen,"During the vehicle selection phase in the race lobby, the selected vehicle (Karin Sultan RS) is rendered intersecting with the wind turbine blades in the background. This clipping issue causes the car to appear embedded inside the turbine blades, which is visually jarring and may confuse players about the environment or vehicle positioning. This bug does not affect gameplay directly but impacts visual fidelity and immersion during the pre-race setup.",Environment and Vehicle Rendering,"Ground truth: a car’s body is clipping into/inside a large wind-turbine blade. Generated report: during the vehicle-selection screen, the chosen car model is rendered intersecting (clipping) with wind-turbine blades so the car appears embedded in them. Both describe the same visual bug: a vehicle mesh intersecting with wind-turbine blades, producing clipping. Although the generated report specifies the context as the vehicle-selection screen while the ground truth is more general, no conflicting detail indicates a different issue; the essential symptom (car stuck/clipping in turbine blade) is identical.",True

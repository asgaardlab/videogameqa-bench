Occasionally the body jitters and briefly drifts, then snaps back under the chopper, further confirming it is not actually tethered by the expected rappel system.

The NPC remains frozen in a stiff upright pose directly beneath the helicopter and moves identically with the aircraft as if rigidly parented, breaking immersion. The lack of proper tether causes occasional jittering and makes the character appear to levitate.

Generated report: focuses on an enemy NPC that is hanging/floating under a helicopter because the rappel rope and animation are missing. It does not mention rotor blades at all; the helicopter’s flight is assumed normal.

The character is not using any of the intended passenger seats, handholds, or rappel points and is unaffected by wind, gravity, or rotor collision. This positioning cannot be achieved through normal controls and therefore indicates that the attachment/seat synchronization logic failed, leaving the avatar incorrectly parented to the vehicle model.</pre></td>

The avatar is locked in a stationary idle pose and moves perfectly with the helicopter’s position and rotation, ignoring collision with the spinning blades as well as gravity. The glitch breaks immersion, can reveal player positions to enemies, and suggests a broader issue with seat assignment or network synchronization that could lead to more severe physics or collision errors (e.g., falling through world, unexpected deaths).</pre></td>

The generated report only describes the first part (a character spawning/standing on the rotor hub) and explicitly implies that the blades are still spinning (“ignoring collision with the spinning blades”). It also lacks mention of the rapid vertical oscillation and instead states the avatar is perfectly stationary. Because the second crucial symptom (frozen rotor blades) and the oscillation behavior are absent—and the generated report even contradicts the rotor-stopped condition—the two descriptions point to different underlying bugs.</pre></td>

The player puts the red Sync-Shot reticle on it, confirming the game still treats it as a normal drivable AI vehicle, yet it completely ignores gravity and remains suspended for the entire sequence.

Generated report: Objects in the dock-yard sometimes fail to stream in, turning black or fully invisible and losing collision. Geometry and collision disappear, letting the player walk through or fall under the map. The fault is missing/ unloaded assets, not a camera penetrating intact geometry.

Although both let the player see the void or go out-of-bounds, the root symptom is different: one is a camera/character clipping through an existing wall; the other is walls not loading at all (no collision). Therefore they do not describe the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

The ground-truth text adds that the character is “stuck” and “floating just above the water in a fixed position,” whereas the generated report says the player can still move horizontally.

No swimming strokes or swim-cycle animation is mentioned; the animation that is stuck is specifically the vehicle-passenger pose, not a swim animation.

Although both issues involve a character floating horizontally above the ground, the specific animation that is erroneously playing – swim cycle vs. vehicle-passenger pose – is different, pointing to different animation-state bugs. Therefore they do not describe the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

Instead of bouncing off, the character snaps onto an invisible ‘ledge’ on the outside of the grate, hangs upside-down, and then ends up standing on a thin pipe that sits flush with the wall. From that position the grate bars have no ledge or further hand-holds, so the player can neither climb up nor drop safely onto another surface. The collision and climbable flags on this vent appear to be set incorrectly: the game thinks the object is a climbable ledge, while the visual mesh clearly has no such surface. This mismatch lets the character partially clip into the grate and creates a dead-end that should not exist in normal traversal flow.</pre></td>

Because no further climb points are defined, the player becomes trapped: cannot mantle over, cannot enter the vent, and has limited room to drop, effectively soft-locking traversal. This suggests the grate’s collision/interaction volume is mis-configured (flagged as climbable when it should be a solid, non-interactive surface).</pre></td>

• Ground truth: ropes remain in place yet begin to “move and shake abruptly” in an unrealistic way. Nothing is said about player interaction, detachment from the post, loss of tension, clipping gaps, or the rope mesh folding into the ring.
• Generated report: problem is triggered by a player colliding with the ropes; the top rope pops off the corner post, loses all tension, stretches, folds, and creates a gap characters can fall through.
The core symptom in the ground truth is uncontrolled shaking while still attached, whereas the generated report focuses on the rope physically detaching and deforming after collision.

The NPC is then stuck several metres above the ground, partially clipping through the wood, playing its idle or attack animation but never falling or re-engaging. The unit cannot be hit by standard melee swings, trivialises combat (because an active threat is effectively removed), and breaks immersion due to the obvious gravity/geometry violation. Corpses can also remain in this position after death, still hovering.

Steps seen in clip:
1. Player kites an enemy around the stall.
2. Enemy triggers a leap attack.
3. On contact with the corner post, the enemy snaps into the beam cavity and freezes.
4. Enemy stays floating for the remainder of the fight, visible in multiple camera angles.

Likely related to incorrect collision resolution between the leap animation capsule and thin environmental geometry.</pre></td>

The core symptoms are (1) occurs only after death, (2) involves continuous vertical movement (bouncing).

Generated report describes a live enemy (during a leap attack) getting wedged in the beams of a small wooden stall, then remaining frozen/levitating several metres above ground. The NPC stops moving (no bouncing) and the problem can persist after it is later killed, but the primary trigger and observable behaviour are different: the enemy is immobilised and static, not endlessly bobbing. Environment is a stall with horizontal beams rather than simply a pillar.

Because the trigger condition, motion behaviour (frozen vs bouncing), and effect differ, the two descriptions refer to different physics bugs.</pre></td>

• Ground truth: the bike &quot;starts levitating, rises into the air, and continues moving while airborne&quot; – it keeps travelling forward as if still being driven.
• Generated report: the bike &quot;remains frozen, upright and floating in mid-air&quot; – it is stuck in place, does not animate, and acts like an inert, desynchronised prop.
The continued forward motion is a key aspect of the ground-truth bug and is explicitly absent in the generated description, which stresses immobility.

• Board wheels and deck slide inside the rail with no resistance.
• Skater’s foot, legs and torso interpenetrate both the rail and nearby ledge.
• A duplicate/ghost of the character briefly appears, suggesting the ragdoll is being spawned at a different position while the original mesh remains.
• Clothing and limbs stretch or pop as the model tries to separate, followed by an exaggerated flailing animation.
• After the bail the character ends up partially embedded in the ground pocket beside the rail.
The glitch breaks immersion, looks visually jarring, and may allow players to exploit collision errors for unintended shortcuts or score exploits.</pre></td>

The generated report, on the other hand, centers on the board and skater penetrating the rail geometry. The overlap triggers the rag-doll system, causes model ghosting, stretching, and finally leaves the character embedded in the ground. The key symptom is collision/clipping through the rail, not merely strange leg rotation while hovering above it.

Although both occur near a rail and both describe odd limb behaviour, the causes and visible results are different: “hovering rotation glitch” versus “collision clipping &amp; rag-doll spasm”. Therefore they should be considered different bugs.</pre></td>

Generated report focuses on two issues that occur after a submission ends: (1) the submission HUD gauge stays on-screen together with the winner banner, and (2) the defeated wrestler keeps looping a stunned rollover animation, which makes him &quot;twitch&quot;. The core problem is the match-end state not clearing UI and not switching animation states.

Although both reports mention a shaking / twitching character on the mat, the generated report’s problem is specifically about an incorrect state transition at match end and persistent UI; it does not mention the hand clipping into the torso that defines the ground-truth bug.

Because it is inside the geometry its health bar remains, combat cannot progress, and the player can bypass the fight. Key elements: (1) droid is partially inside wall; (2) remains stuck permanently; (3) causes encounter soft-lock.

Impact:
• Breaks visual realism and immersion.
• May interfere with line-of-sight or interaction checks if the body is used for AI detection or physics triggers.
• Suggests a wider issue with collision channels between rag-doll skeletons and industrial walkway/barrier assets.</pre></td>

Generated report: after a melee kill, the enemy corpse (ragdoll) begins to oscillate, spins, stretches, clips through floor/doorway, and parts float.
Key common elements:
• Trigger: player attack/kill of an enemy NPC.
• Resulting behavior: ragdoll/ corpse displays extreme, unrealistic physics – spinning, shaking, stretching/ distortion, parts floating or hovering off the ground.
• Symptom type: ragdoll physics glitch causing visually broken, immersion-breaking animation.
Differences such as mentioning a doorway collision, floor sinking, or not explicitly stating the initial few-second freeze are secondary and plausible variations of the same underlying ragdoll-spasm bug.

This inconsistency suggests a bug where the vehicle's confirmation status is not updating correctly or is being toggled erroneously, which could impact gameplay by preventing players from properly confirming their vehicle selections.",Inconsistent Vehicle Confirmation Status Updates,"The vehicle confirmation status toggles unexpectedly between 'Unconfirmed' and 'Confirmed' states during the selection process. This inconsistency may cause confusion for players and could prevent them from properly confirming their vehicle choice, potentially leading to gameplay issues or frustration.",Vehicle confirmation status UI,"The ground truth bug concerns a physics/geometry problem where a car is physically stuck and clipping into a wind-turbine blade in the game world. The generated bug report concerns a UI logic issue where a vehicle confirmation status in the menu toggles between ‘Unconfirmed’ and ‘Confirmed’. These describe entirely different systems (gameworld physics vs. menu UI), different symptoms (clipping vs. status toggle), and different user impact. Therefore they are not the same underlying bug.",False

The generated report describes a graphical/visual effect glitch (red/black distortion) when the player uses a biotic power. The symptoms, context, and affected functionality are entirely different: one concerns NPC movement/physics after being shot, the other concerns player visual effects during biotic powers. Hence they are not the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

It does not mention the distinctive behavior of the ATV circling by itself nor any interaction with a dead NPC body.

Generated report: describes a collision with a horse-drawn carriage during horseback riding that ejects the player from the horse; then mentions extra side-effects (clipping, ragdoll problems).
Core elements—the situation (player on horse), the object involved (horse carriage), the event (collision) and the result (player thrown off)—are identical.

Key elements coincide: (1) object becomes stuck in the swing set, (2) sudden powerful launch into the air caused by physics glitch. Although the generated report says the launched object ends up being the player’s corpse rather than explicitly mentioning the car flying away, it is still describing the same well-known swing-set physics bug—the unpredictable catapulting effect when something gets trapped in the swing set.

Although both mention a headless body and missing armor, the situation that causes it, the character involved, and the faulty behaviour differ: one is an immediate transformation on entering armor, the other is post-mortem behaviour after a headshot, and the latter stresses continued AI behaviour, not the size/nakedness transformation.

Because the symptoms and underlying issues differ (sliding vs. clipping), the two reports do not describe the same bug.</pre></td>

In the generated report the character clips through a door and the wooden supports of the same building, and as a result can even fall through the structure and the ground, likewise exposing empty space. The concrete symptoms (camera shows void vs character falls) differ slightly, but they stem from the same underlying defect: the building/door/support geometry lacks proper collision boundaries, allowing the player to enter or go through it and see the unrendered “void.” Therefore the generated report is describing the same core bug.</pre></td>

They involve helicopters, but the symptoms, trigger, and problem are completely different: one is about static rotor blades during flight, the other about entity disappearance on projectile impact. Therefore they are not the same bug.</pre></td>

Both describe an NPC/character hovering unnaturally in the train-track environment, implying a physics/collision issue that leaves the character suspended in mid-air. The difference between “above the tracks” and “above a train car” is minor and does not change the essence of the bug (floating character near the train area).

The glitch appears intermittently during a dialogue sequence. This suggests an issue with the character model loading or rendering correctly.,Ashley Williams - Missing Head During Dialogue,"During a conversation with Ashley Williams, her head intermittently disappears, leaving only her neck and shoulders visible. This occurs throughout the dialogue sequence and is visually jarring. It does not appear to affect gameplay functionality beyond visual fidelity, but it is a significant graphical bug. The issue seems to be related to the character model rendering, potentially a problem with the mesh or texture loading.",Character Model (Ashley Williams),"Ground truth refers to an NPC frozen in a T-pose/A-pose whose legs do not animate, resulting in sliding movement and floating. The generated report concerns a completely different symptom: the character’s head disappears intermittently during dialogue while the body presumably animates normally. No mention of T-pose, sliding, lack of leg animation, or movement issues is present. Conversely, the ground truth does not mention missing body parts or head disappearance. Therefore the two reports describe different bugs.",False

The character continues to fall, likely resulting in death. This occurs despite the player being at a height where a parachute should be functional. This could be due to a bug in the parachute deployment logic, a collision detection issue preventing deployment, or a problem with the game recognizing the need for a parachute.","Character, Parachute System, Physics","Ground truth focuses on a visual/anatomical inconsistency: a helicopter remains airborne even though its rotor blades are not spinning.

It may also impact player perception of the helicopter's speed and movement.",Helicopter (visual model/animation),"The ground-truth bug centers on the fact that a helicopter is airborne while its rotor blades are completely still. The generated report likewise describes the rotor blades as static (""not animating as expected,"" ""displayed as solid, static objects""). Although the ground truth also mentions a character oscillating on top of the helicopter, that detail is incidental; the unique technical fault is the non-moving rotor during flight. Both descriptions identify this same visual/animation failure of the helicopter’s rotors, so they refer to the same underlying bug.",True

This occurs when moving across the ship's surface. The player falls into the water below, and a 'Desynchronization' message appears, likely indicating a game over or checkpoint reload. This severely impacts gameplay as it prevents progression and forces a reload.

The key symptom is the temporary, unnatural levitation beside the ship.
Generated report: character walks on the ship’s deck and immediately falls THROUGH the deck into the water, triggering a desync. There is no mention of getting stuck or floating beside the ship; the location (on top of the deck) and manifestation (passing through a collision mesh) differ from the ground-truth hover glitch.

Generated report: NPC body ""floats and contorts,"" appears headless, and keeps sliding for a long time. The body is not described as sinking through the floor or disappearing; instead it stays visible, deforms, and moves across the surface.

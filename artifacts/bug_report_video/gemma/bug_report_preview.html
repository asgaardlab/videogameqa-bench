Generated report: Describes the enemy continually playing the “hit” animation after it has been defeated. It emphasises an animation-state loop (enemy keeps reacting to hits) rather than any physical bouncing or interaction with a pillar or other object.

While both happen after the enemy is killed, the key symptom in one is physics-based bouncing near a pillar, in the other it is being stuck in a hit animation loop independent of environment.

It does not mention any sudden emergence, motion, or interaction with (let alone killing) the player; it frames the problem mainly as a visual glitch that might cause physics problems.

While both reports involve a helicopter being partly inside world geometry, the manifestations and player impact differ significantly: one is a lethal emergence event, the other is a persistent clipping artefact.

Generated report: ATV is stuck (lodged) inside a car, with portions clipping through the car chassis. Motion/circling is not mentioned, the other object is a car rather than a corpse, and the context is different (lodged vs spinning).

Key points: occurs during an animation sequence, truck becomes airborne (hovering) and clips through building walls/floors.

Generated report talks about normal gameplay use of a delivery truck for nightclub supply missions whose chassis/wheels are partially embedded in a loading-dock platform. No mention of an animation sequence, hovering/airborne state, wall penetration inside a building, or movement into a building; instead it describes the truck sunk into the dock surface.

Although both involve a truck clipping with environment geometry, the contexts and symptoms differ (airborne vs embedded, animation vs static positioning, building interior vs loading dock). Therefore they are very likely different bugs.</pre></td>

Ground truth: NPC falls through the ground – it clips downward and finally disappears below the map. The key symptom is the character passing through the terrain (no collision) until it is gone.

Generated report: NPC body &quot;floats and contorts,&quot; appears headless, and keeps sliding for a long time. The body is not described as sinking through the floor or disappearing; instead it stays visible, deforms, and moves across the surface.

Because the ground-truth bug is specifically about the character clipping through and falling out of the world, while the generated report focuses on deformation and floating above/on the surface, they are most likely different issues even though both lie in the ragdoll system.</pre></td>

The emphasis is on an excessive upward launch impulse, not on hovering after landing, and no rotation is mentioned.

Although both descriptions involve enemies ending up off the ground, the sequence and nature of the physics error differ: one is an unwanted launch impulse, the other is hovering/rotating after already landing. These are likely distinct bugs.</pre></td>

The generated bug report instead describes a UI problem in which the vehicle/character selection interface keeps looping during a race. These involve different game systems (physics vs. user interface), different symptoms (object clipping vs. persistent menus), and occur under different conditions. Therefore, they are not the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

Instead of maintaining a consistent position or moving naturally through the environment, the character teleports to different locations between frames. The character appears at various points along the corridor, sometimes near stairs, sometimes further away, with no transition animations between positions. This creates a jarring visual experience as the NPC seems to 'jump' around the environment while the dialogue UI remains active. The character also occasionally appears to hover slightly above the ground plane.",Character animation and positioning system for NPCs during dialogue sequences,"Ground truth describes an NPC whose animation is stuck in a T-pose/A-pose: the model keeps the default pose, legs do not animate, and the character slides continuously (e.g., up stairs) while slightly floating. The key traits are: T-pose, no leg animation, continuous sliding movement.

Generated report instead describes an NPC that teleports to different positions between frames during a dialogue scene. There is no mention of the character being locked in a T-pose or sliding; the defect is discrete position jumps rather than continuous sliding with static pose. Although it mentions occasional hovering, that alone is insufficient—the defining T-pose/sliding behavior is absent and the teleporting behavior is not in the ground truth.

Because the symptoms and animation problems differ significantly, the two reports refer to different underlying bugs.",False

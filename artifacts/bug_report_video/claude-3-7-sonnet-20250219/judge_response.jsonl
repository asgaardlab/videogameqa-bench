The key behaviour is a brief mid-air freeze independent of climbing, animation distortion, or terrain clipping.\\n\\nGenerated report: concerns a climbing scenario where the character\u2019s animation becomes distorted (rotates sideways/upside-down, clips through terrain, mis-aligns). One symptom mentioned is that the character \\\"appears to be suspended in mid-air while still in a climbing pose\\\", but this is part of a broader climbing-animation glitch and there is no mention that the suspension lasts only a couple of seconds or that the character subsequently falls normally. The primary issue described is animation/attachment problems on climbing surfaces, not a short physics freeze followed by a fall.\\n\\nBecause the circumstances (during climbing vs any general movement), additional symptoms (animation distortion, clipping) and likely root cause differ, these descriptions point to different bugs.\",\"match\":false}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens": 613, "total_tokens": 1050, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 384, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Instead of maintaining a consistent position or moving naturally through the environment, the character teleports to different locations between frames. The character appears at various points along the corridor, sometimes near stairs, sometimes further away, with no transition animations between positions. This creates a jarring visual experience as the NPC seems to &#x27;jump&#x27; around the environment while the dialogue UI remains active. The character also occasionally appears to hover slightly above the ground plane.</pre></td>

The key traits are: T-pose, no leg animation, continuous sliding movement.

Generated report instead describes an NPC that teleports to different positions between frames during a dialogue scene. There is no mention of the character being locked in a T-pose or sliding; the defect is discrete position jumps rather than continuous sliding with static pose. Although it mentions occasional hovering, that alone is insufficient—the defining T-pose/sliding behavior is absent and the teleporting behavior is not in the ground truth.

Because the symptoms and animation problems differ significantly, the two reports refer to different underlying bugs.</pre></td>

In realistic physics, a suspended body should exhibit some movement, swinging, or animation, especially as the helicopter moves through the air. Instead, the figure appears to be frozen in a single pose without any natural physics-based movement or animation, making it look like a static model rather than a dynamic object.</pre></td>

Generated report: character lands on the deck, collision with deck plane fails immediately, so the avatar clips straight through the solid geometry and falls into the water, triggering desync. There is no mention of being stuck floating beside the ship, nor of a prolonged fall animation; the problem is specifically “falling through the deck” rather than “hanging in mid-air along the ship’s side”.

Although both issues involve ship-related collision problems that end with the player in the water, the symptoms and locations are different and point to different collision errors. Therefore they are unlikely to be the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

Generated report: describes the officer “sitting in mid-air without any supporting surface,” maintaining a seated pose over several frames. It does not explicitly mention the missing car or person, but the visual symptom it highlights (officer hovering in seated position) is exactly what a viewer would observe when the car model is invisible. Both reports therefore point to the same underlying rendering issue where surrounding objects (car, person) are not drawn, leaving only the officer visible and apparently floating. Differences in wording (calling it a physics glitch, mentioning a bus-stop) do not contradict the essential symptom.

Hence they describe the same bug.</pre></td>

The transitions are instantaneous and jarring, with no logical progression between scenes. At times, the camera clips through environmental objects or the character model partially embeds into surfaces. The glitch appears to trigger when interacting with or approaching certain structures, particularly the blue door, and makes normal gameplay impossible as the player loses control of their position in the game world.</pre></td>

• Generated report: the moment the player approaches a blue door the character’s entire position is repeatedly teleported to totally different places (walkways, scaffolding, other town areas). This is a severe positional warp, not just a camera poking through a wall.  
The teleportation and multi-location jumps are the core of the generated report and are not present in the ground-truth description; conversely, the &quot;void behind the wall&quot; symptom that defines the ground-truth bug is never mentioned in the generated report.

Similarity: both concern aircraft destruction physics looking unrealistic.
Differences that matter:
 • Ground truth mentions the aircraft is thrown upward; generated report says the aircraft just stays where it is (hovers) – no upward projection.
 • Ground truth says there are debris pieces that are present but wrong; generated report says there are NO pieces, the model remains intact.

These are different symptoms and point to different malfunctions in the destruction system (wrong debris mesh vs no breakup at all). Therefore the generated report does not describe the same underlying bug as the ground-truth description.</pre></td>

The sequence shows the player character navigating through what appears to be an abandoned building, but there are multiple instances where NPCs exhibit unnatural movement patterns. Most notably, there&#x27;s a character in a yellow outfit who appears to clip through walls and move in erratic, physically impossible ways. Additionally, there&#x27;s an NPC who falls to the ground but displays unnatural ragdoll physics, with the body sliding and rotating in ways that defy realistic physics.

Generated report: concerns a climbing scenario where the character’s animation becomes distorted (rotates sideways/upside-down, clips through terrain, mis-aligns). One symptom mentioned is that the character &quot;appears to be suspended in mid-air while still in a climbing pose&quot;, but this is part of a broader climbing-animation glitch and there is no mention that the suspension lasts only a couple of seconds or that the character subsequently falls normally. The primary issue described is animation/attachment problems on climbing surfaces, not a short physics freeze followed by a fall.

Because the circumstances (during climbing vs any general movement), additional symptoms (animation distortion, clipping) and likely root cause differ, these descriptions point to different bugs.</pre></td>

The front portion of the vehicle is clipping through the solid barrier instead of sitting properly on or against it. This collision detection failure creates an unrealistic visual where approximately 30-40% of the vehicle is merged with the solid wall. The glitch persists throughout the entire vehicle selection process and is visible from multiple camera angles.</pre></td>

Although both refer to vehicle clipping into static geometry, the specific object (wind-turbine blade vs. concrete wall), context (in-game world vs. pre-race menu/garage), and scenario (car stuck during gameplay vs. during vehicle-selection UI) differ, indicating they are not the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

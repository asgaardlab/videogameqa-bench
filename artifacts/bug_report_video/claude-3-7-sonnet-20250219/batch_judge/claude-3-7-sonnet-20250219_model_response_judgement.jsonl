The character's body rotates unnaturally, sometimes appearing sideways or upside-down relative to the climbing surface. The character model clips through terrain and fails to properly align with the climbing surface. At several points, the character appears to be suspended in mid-air while still in a climbing pose.

The boat shatters into flat, paper-like pieces that float unnaturally on the water surface. The character doesn't transition properly to a swimming animation but instead continues the rowing motion despite no longer having a vessel.

The defining symptoms are: (1) character is locked in a reference pose, (2) no proper walking animation plays, (3) sliding/floating movement results.

The generated report only says the character’s movements are “stiff and robotic” and that the limbs move unnaturally while walking. It does not mention the character being fixed in a T-pose/A-pose, nor sliding/floating without leg animation. Instead, it implies that some (incorrect) limb animation still plays during normal walking. Therefore it describes a more general animation quality issue, not the specific T-pose sliding bug of the ground truth.

Because the key signature behavior (T-pose/A-pose with sliding) is absent, the two reports are about different underlying issues.</pre></td>

The mention of a character &quot;beneath&quot; the helicopter is incidental; the key symptom is the missing rotor animation while the helicopter is airborne.

The generated report focuses on the character: the character is “hanging” or “suspended in mid-air” and is not interacting correctly with physics. It does not mention the rotor blades at all, nor does it describe the helicopter’s ability to stay aloft without spinning rotors. The core symptom it highlights (character’s physics) is different from the core symptom in the ground truth (helicopter flying with static rotors).

Because the primary issues described are different, the two reports do not refer to the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

The generated report only mentions a character already on the roof who is simply standing/stuck there with no visible support and not moving. It lacks the launch/projection event, the abnormal animation pose, and even states the character remains stationary rather than continuing to walk. While both reports involve a character being on a roof in an unrealistic way, the symptom details and behavior differ enough to suggest they are describing different glitches (one about being launched and walking, the other about being stuck/hovering). Therefore they do not describe the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

Generated report: describes a motorcycle-mounted character who is seen &quot;floating or hovering above the ground, defying normal physics&quot; and remains suspended while the bike is moving near a curved structure. It calls out a physics glitch affecting a motorcycle/character combination.
Both reports concern a motorcycle-riding character that unexpectedly rises off the track and stays airborne, pointing to the same underlying physics-levitation bug.

Although the generated text does not explicitly state the object is an NPC nor mention that the distortion worsens while driving, it still captures the same fundamental issue: a wrongly rendered/distorted mesh located on the car roof that moves with the vehicle.

• Ground truth: the bug is that a horse carriage suddenly spawns in the rider’s path, causing an unexpected collision. The key issue is the carriage pop-in and resulting collision.
• Generated report: focuses on the aftermath of a fall—the player lies motionless due to animation/physics not resuming. It never mentions a carriage, sudden object appearance, or unintended collision triggering the fall.
Because the generated report describes a post-fall animation/physics freeze rather than the carriage pop-in collision, the two reports are not about the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

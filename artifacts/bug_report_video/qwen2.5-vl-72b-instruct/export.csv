Her movements appear to be stiff and robotic, lacking the fluidity expected from a human-like character. This suggests a potential issue with the animation or physics engine, which could affect the immersion and realism of the game.",Character Animation Glitch: Stiff and Unnatural Movements,"In the video, Ashley Williams exhibits stiff and robotic movements as she walks through the environment. The character's limbs move in a way that does not mimic natural human motion, indicating a possible glitch in the animation system. This can detract from the immersive experience and may impact gameplay if it affects interactions or combat sequences.",Character (Ashley Williams),"The ground-truth bug is specifically about an NPC that remains in a T-pose/A-pose while moving – the legs do not animate, the character floats/slides up stairs and across the ground. The defining symptoms are: (1) character is locked in a reference pose, (2) no proper walking animation plays, (3) sliding/floating movement results.

The generated report only says the character’s movements are “stiff and robotic” and that the limbs move unnaturally while walking. It does not mention the character being fixed in a T-pose/A-pose, nor sliding/floating without leg animation. Instead, it implies that some (incorrect) limb animation still plays during normal walking. Therefore it describes a more general animation quality issue, not the specific T-pose sliding bug of the ground truth.

Because the key signature behavior (T-pose/A-pose with sliding) is absent, the two reports are about different underlying issues.",False

The character appears to be suspended in mid-air, which is unusual and may indicate a physics glitch. The character's position relative to the helicopter does not change, suggesting that they are stuck or not following expected physical laws.",Character Suspended in Mid-Air While Attached to Helicopter,"In the video, a character is seen hanging from a helicopter while flying over a forest. The character remains stationary in relation to the helicopter, defying normal gravitational and physical expectations. This behavior suggests a potential physics engine bug where the character is not properly interacting with the environment or the helicopter's movement.",Character attached to helicopter,"Ground truth bug is that the helicopter is able to fly even though its rotor blades are completely motionless. The mention of a character ""beneath"" the helicopter is incidental; the key symptom is the missing rotor animation while the helicopter is airborne.

The generated report focuses on the character: the character is “hanging” or “suspended in mid-air” and is not interacting correctly with physics. It does not mention the rotor blades at all, nor does it describe the helicopter’s ability to stay aloft without spinning rotors. The core symptom it highlights (character’s physics) is different from the core symptom in the ground truth (helicopter flying with static rotors).

Because the primary issues described are different, the two reports do not refer to the same underlying bug.",False

This behavior is unusual and defies the expected physics of the game, as characters should not be able to stand on moving vehicles without falling off. The character's position appears stable, suggesting a glitch in the collision detection or physics engine.",Character Stands on Moving Helicopter Without Falling,"A player character is observed standing on top of a flying helicopter, maintaining balance despite the movement of the vehicle. This violates typical game physics where characters would be expected to fall off due to motion and lack of grip. This glitch could potentially allow players to exploit the game by gaining an unintended vantage point or avoiding obstacles.",Character Physics and Collision Detection,"Ground truth bug has two key symptoms: (1) the helicopter is airborne even though its rotor blades are completely still, and (2) the character on top of the helicopter rapidly oscillates up and down. The generated report focuses on a different problem: the character can stand stably on a moving helicopter without falling off, citing a physics/collision issue, and makes no mention of stationary rotor blades or the character’s rapid oscillation. In fact, it explicitly states the character ""maintains balance,"" which contradicts the oscillation behavior in the ground truth. Because the primary phenomena described differ, these reports do not refer to the same underlying bug.",False

It does not appear to be following any logical path or physical laws within the game's environment. This could potentially disrupt gameplay by causing confusion or unintended interactions with players.",Object in the sky,"Ground truth describes a bug where a car is suspended in mid-air, spinning and drifting away – essentially a vehicle that is defying gravity and normal physics. 
The generated report states that “there is an object floating in the sky that moves in an unexpected manner … not following any logical path or physical laws.” This covers the same core symptoms: an entity (object/car) is floating in the air and behaving contrary to physics. Although the generated report omits the detail that the object is specifically a car and does not explicitly mention rotation, the essential anomalous behaviour (floating in the air and moving unnaturally) is the same. No conflicting details are introduced. Therefore they refer to the same underlying bug.",True

This suggests a potential glitch where the character unexpectedly exits the boat and begins swimming without any apparent player input or logical transition.",Character Unexpectedly Exits Boat and Begins Swimming,"In the video, the character is initially seen rowing a boat across a body of water. However, at a certain point, the character suddenly exits the boat and starts swimming. There is no visible action from the player that would indicate an intention to leave the boat, suggesting a possible bug in the game's physics or character control system. This unexpected behavior could disrupt gameplay by forcing the player into an unintended state, potentially leading to mission failure if the character cannot return to the boat or reach their destination.",Character (player-controlled) and boat,"Ground truth bug: while player stays on partially-submerged boat, simply walking on its deck makes the boat slide/shift forward unnaturally. Core issue is unwanted boat movement caused by player movement.
Generated report: player unexpectedly leaves the boat and begins swimming; problem is involuntary dismount, not boat movement. No mention of boat sliding when walked upon, and the character’s movement effect on boat is not discussed. These are different symptoms and likely different underlying physics issues.",False

This could be a glitch where the game fails to properly switch or hide one of the weapons when another is equipped.",Simultaneous Dual-Wielding Glitch,"In the video, the player character is seen holding both a bow and a sword at the same time. Normally, equipping a new weapon should replace the current one, but here both weapons are visible. This can confuse players and may affect gameplay mechanics related to weapon switching and combat.",Weapons (Bow and Sword),"The ground truth describes a physics bug where an animal (deer) is launched into the air after being shot with an arrow. The generated report discusses a visual/equipment glitch where the player simultaneously holds a bow and a sword, which is unrelated to the animal-launching physics issue.

The game displays a 'Desynchronization' message, indicating that the player has fallen out of the playable area or encountered a glitch where the game cannot properly render the environment. This suggests an issue with collision detection or pathfinding.",Character Falls Out of Bounds During Ship Jump,"In the video, the player character attempts to jump from one ship to another during a naval battle. However, instead of landing on the target ship, the character falls into the water and triggers a 'Desynchronization' message. This indicates that the game failed to properly calculate the jump trajectory or collision detection, causing the character to fall out of bounds. This glitch can disrupt gameplay by forcing the player to restart the mission.","Player Character, Collision Detection, Pathfinding","Ground truth: after jumping to another ship, character gets stuck in mid-air on the ship’s side, floating while the falling animation plays, then later drops into water. Key symptom = being suspended/stuck for a period before falling.
Generated report: character tries to jump to other ship but immediately falls into water/out of bounds and triggers desynchronization. No mention of being suspended or stuck; the failure happens right away.
Although both involve jumping between ships, the distinctive behavior (mid-air sticking vs immediate fall) differs, meaning they likely represent different collision issues.",False

This suggests a physics glitch where the character model is not interacting correctly with the environment, likely due to an error in collision detection or animation scripting.",Character Floating Mid-Air,"A police officer character is suspended in the air without any visible support, indicating a physics anomaly. The character's posture and position suggest that they should be on the ground, but instead, they are hovering above it. This could disrupt gameplay by preventing normal interactions and movements.",Character (Police Officer),"Ground truth: the bug is that the police car and the person being arrested are invisible; only the officer is visible. The core issue is missing/invisible objects.
Generated report: describes the officer ‘suspended in the air’ and calls it a physics/hovering anomaly. It does not mention any missing or invisible car/person, and it attributes the problem to physics rather than invisibility of other objects.
While an invisible car could make the officer appear to float, the generated report does not identify that invisibility is the issue; instead it frames it as an unrelated floating/physics problem. Because the described root symptom (objects invisible vs. character floating) and presumed cause differ, they should be considered different bugs.",False

This suggests a glitch in the game's physics engine.",Floating Fabric Defies Water Physics,"In the video, the character is seen swimming in the water while holding or interacting with a piece of fabric. The fabric floats upright and does not sink or move naturally with the water currents, indicating a physics anomaly. This could affect gameplay by creating unrealistic interactions with objects in the water.",Fabric or cloth object,"Ground truth bug concerns a boat that abruptly accelerates and crashes/explodes without cause. Generated report concerns cloth/fabric object floating unnaturally in water, a physics anomaly unrelated to boat movement or crashes. Symptoms, affected objects, and conditions differ entirely.",False

The character's movement and positioning seem normal, but the lack of any visible glitch or anomaly suggests that the focus might be on the character's interaction with the environment or potential pathfinding issues.",Character Crouching Behavior in Construction Site,"The character is seen crouching and moving through a construction site area. There are no apparent graphical glitches or rendering issues. However, the behavior could be scrutinized for any unintended interactions with objects or the environment, such as clipping through objects or unexpected collision responses.",Character,"The ground truth bug concerns an NPC who is climbing through a window and, after being shot, vanishes (a disappearance/despawn issue triggered by damage). The generated report talks about a character crouching and moving in a construction-site area, possibly clipping or having collision issues, but explicitly states there are no graphical glitches observed. It does not mention being shot, climbing, a window ledge, or disappearance. The symptoms, conditions, and location differ entirely, so they are not describing the same bug.",False

The generated report talks about a character-selection screen with no glitches at all. The subject matter (vehicle/environment clipping vs. UI screen with no issues), affected objects, and symptoms are completely different, so they do not refer to the same bug.",False

This is not typical gameplay behavior and suggests a glitch or an unexpected event. The players are stationary, and there is no active play occurring.",Game Pauses Unexpectedly During Match,"During the match, the game unexpectedly pauses, displaying a large overlay text that reads '19 MINUT 33' and 'HALF'. Players are frozen in place, and there is no ongoing action. This pause disrupts the flow of the game and may affect player experience by causing confusion or delays.",Gameplay mechanics and user interface,"Ground truth bug is about AI/player positioning behavior: blue-jersey players bunch up in a small area instead of spreading out. Generated report is about the game suddenly pausing with an on-screen overlay ('19 MINUT 33', 'HALF') and all players freezing. This pertains to an unexpected pause/UI issue, not to abnormal player movement while play continues. The core symptoms and affected functionality differ, so the two reports describe different issues.",False

The scene appears stable and consistent with the game's normal operation.",None,"The ground truth describes a clear visual bug: a tanker truck that shakes or oscillates while the rest of the scene is stable. The generated report explicitly states that no visual glitches or anomalies were detected and that everything appears normal. Therefore, it denies the existence of the very issue highlighted in the ground truth. The two reports describe opposite observations.",False

This behavior is not typical for a soccer game, as players should either be standing or performing realistic falling animations. The sliding motion suggests a physics glitch where the character model is not interacting with the environment as expected.",Player Character Sliding Unnaturally on Ground,"During gameplay, a player character in a blue uniform is observed lying on the ground and sliding across the field without any apparent interaction with other players or the ball. This glitch disrupts the realism of the game, as characters should either stand up or remain stationary after falling. The issue may affect gameplay by preventing the player from participating effectively in the match.",Character (player in blue uniform),"Ground truth bug: after a red player tackles, the tackled player is launched into the air. Key symptoms: tackle event, upward/airborne motion.
Generated report: a blue-uniformed player lies on the ground and slides across the field without interaction or being airborne. No tackle, no being thrown upward; instead it is horizontal sliding.
Because the core behaviors (airborne launch vs ground sliding) and triggering conditions (tackle vs no interaction) are different, they do not describe the same underlying bug.",False

This behavior is unexpected and could be considered a glitch because helicopters typically maintain a higher altitude to avoid obstacles. The proximity to the trees suggests a potential collision issue or physics anomaly in the game.",Helicopter Flying Too Close to Trees,"In the video, a helicopter is seen flying at an extremely low altitude, dangerously close to the tree canopy. This unusual flight path may indicate a problem with the game's collision detection or physics engine, as helicopters should not fly so close to obstacles without risking damage. This glitch could impact gameplay by causing unexpected crashes or altering the player's strategy when using vehicles.",Helicopter,"Ground truth bug: helicopter pops up from beneath the ground (spawn/clipping through terrain) and immediately kills the player. Core symptoms: emerges from ground, collision with player leading to death.
Generated report: helicopter flies very low, close to tree canopy, possible collision-detection issue with trees; no mention of emerging from ground or killing the player. Different scenario, different environment element (trees vs. ground) and no player death described.
Thus the two descriptions refer to different issues.",False

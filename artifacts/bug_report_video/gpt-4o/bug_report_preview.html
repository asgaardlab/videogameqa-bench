Because the root behavior (oscillation vs. clipping and being stuck) and the conditions are different, the two reports are not describing the same bug.</pre></td>

Generated report: Describes the character’s head clipping through the interior when the player is inside a vehicle, producing visual obstruction. It identifies a mis-alignment between character and vehicle models that blocks the player’s view.

Core symptom in both: camera/character model clipping inside a vehicle that obstructs the player’s view. Both involve the player being inside a vehicle and seeing parts of the character model instead of the intended view. The generated report omits the specific trigger that an NPC is in the driver’s seat, but that detail is not incompatible and does not describe a different effect; it only leaves out a reproduction condition.

Trigger = combat action; objects affected = enemy bodies vs world props.

Generated report speaks of a character who simply walks up to a truck, the back door opens, and the character passes through the door because of missing collision. It does not involve combat knock-back, rag-doll physics, or the enemy bodies clipping into the truck interior; it is specifically about the truck door having no collision during normal movement.

Although both mention a truck and clipping, the circumstances, objects, and symptoms differ: ground truth is about enemies being propelled/clipped inside the truck body, not about passing through the truck’s door. Therefore they do not describe the same underlying bug.</pre></td>

Both reports revolve around the same fundamental issue: faulty collision with a car object leading to the character clipping into the car and potentially getting stuck.

Although it does not explicitly mention rotor blades, the key abnormality is the same: the helicopter is airborne despite the absence of the motion (rotor movement) that would normally keep it aloft.

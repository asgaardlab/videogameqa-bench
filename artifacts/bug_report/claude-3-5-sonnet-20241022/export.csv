The character's proportions are unrealistically distorted.",Character Model Scale and Proportion Glitch in Garage Scene,"Character model is rendering at approximately 5-6 times normal scale, causing severe proportion issues relative to environment assets. The character appears to be the size of a small building, dwarfing a nearby vehicle. Texture resolution on the jeans remains consistent despite the scaling, suggesting a rendering or model loading error rather than an intentional design choice. This could significantly impact gameplay by causing collision detection issues and blocking player visibility.","Player/NPC character model, specifically affecting the entire character's scale in relation to the game environment","Ground truth bug: character is floating in the air while sitting — an issue of incorrect position (vertical offset).

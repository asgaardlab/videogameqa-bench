This glitch may impact the player's immersion and could interfere with aiming or gameplay visibility.",Character's hand and weapon,"Ground truth bug is about the character’s hand clipping through the torso and coming out of the belly. The generated report speaks of the hand and weapon being duplicated/overlapped, implying double visuals rather than the hand penetrating the body. It does not mention clipping into the torso or emerging from the belly, and focuses on duplication/overlap issues instead. Therefore, they are describing different visual problems.",False

This may impact immersion and could be caused by a rendering bug or model clipping issue.",Player character's head/model,"Ground truth bug concerns the position/orientation of a dead animal that a person is carrying. The generated report talks about a visual glitch where the character’s own head is distorted or overlapping. The subject (animal vs. character head) and the nature of the issue (incorrect positioning vs. overlapping/distorted mesh) are different, so they do not refer to the same bug.",False

Additionally, the presence of a yellow diamond icon with a distance indicator suggests a quest marker, but the faint 'YES' overlay appears out of place and may interfere with gameplay clarity.",Unintended 'YES' Overlay in Upper Right Corner,"A faint, semi-transparent 'YES' text is visible in the upper right corner of the screen, which does not seem to serve any purpose and appears to be a graphical or UI rendering glitch. This overlay could distract players or obscure important UI elements during gameplay.",UI overlay / graphical interface,"The ground truth bug concerns improperly rendered animals (bull and cow) floating above the ground, i.e., an environmental/physics rendering issue.

Generated: a helicopter is floating in mid-air very close to a wall, suggesting collision/render bug causing suspension. Both reports describe an aircraft model that is unrealistically suspended in the air near/against a wall, indicating a placement/clipping problem. Although the generated report calls the craft a helicopter and omits the non-rotating propeller detail, the fundamental bug (aircraft floating and intersecting/near a wall) is the same.",True

The generated report talks generally about environmental distortion, misaligned objects, overlapping floor, and misplaced character models, but it never references the flashlight’s square light patch. While it does mention objects and characters being misplaced/overlapping, that is too generic and does not specifically match the described clipping of the zombie by the table. The key flashlight artifact is entirely absent. Therefore, the generated report does not describe the same bug(s).</pre></td>

This graphical glitch breaks immersion and may interfere with gameplay by obscuring character animations or actions.",Character model (upper back and shoulder area),"Ground truth states the mesh is heavily distorted such that parts of the surrounding environment (straw hut, etc.) project/extend onto the person’s clothing. The core problem is a severe mesh/texture distortion on the character’s back area. 
The generated report says the character’s upper back and shoulder area shows “extreme texture stretching and mesh distortion,” creating an unnatural appearance. Although it doesn’t explicitly mention the straw hut/environment being projected, it describes the same fundamental symptom (severe mesh and texture distortion on the character’s back).

It could also affect gameplay if the character's hitbox or animations are impacted by this rendering issue.",Character model inside the vehicle,Ground truth states that the male character and the blue/cyan vehicle are clipping together. The generated report describes the character seated in the blue vehicle being partially visible because parts of the character are clipped inside the vehicle model. Both emphasize the same visual issue: intersection/clipping between the character model and the blue vehicle. Details such as lower body missing align with clipping. Therefore they describe the same bug.,True
question___0d8c9ce5-ca96-4234-8c77-2a5b0473bde5,gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14,"The front left wheel of the tractor is missing, and the axle is visibly floating without any wheel attached. This is inconsistent with the rest of the vehicle and typical tractor models, indicating a rendering or model loading issue.",Missing Front Left Wheel on Tractor,"The tractor's front left wheel is not rendered, leaving the axle exposed and floating above the ground. This visual glitch breaks immersion and may confuse players about the vehicle's operability or cause collision detection issues.",Tractor front left wheel,"Both descriptions report the same visual issue on the tractor: a front wheel is completely absent in the render. The ground truth mentions the front wheel missing and wheels not fully rendered, while the generated report specifies the front left wheel missing. These are effectively the same defect (absence of the front wheel geometry), so the bug reports align.",True
question___70668d23-1d3c-4c5e-9b0c-6900155cbd8e,gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14,"The sniper rifle (AWP) is visibly floating in mid-air without any character holding it, which is inconsistent with normal game behavior where weapons are either held by players or lying on the ground.",Floating Weapon Model Glitch,"The AWP sniper rifle model is floating in mid-air near the corner of the building, not held by any player or lying on the ground. This visual glitch can confuse players about weapon availability and disrupt immersion. It may also interfere with hitbox detection or player movement if the model is considered a physical object.",Weapon model (AWP sniper rifle),"Both descriptions refer to the same core visual bug: a sniper rifle model (specifically an AWP in the generated report) that is floating in mid-air instead of being properly positioned on the ground or in a player’s hands. The ground-truth mentions part of the barrel clipping into a wall, while the generated report merely states it is floating near a building corner; despite this minor detail variation, the essential issue—an unattached, floating sniper rifle model—is identical.",True

The weapon is not attached to any character or resting on the ground, breaking immersion and potentially confusing players about weapon pickup or interaction. This visual inconsistency may also indicate underlying physics or collision detection issues.",Weapon model (shotgun) in the environment,"The ground truth states that the visual defect is the presence of two floating guns. The generated report describes a gun (specifically a shotgun) floating above the ground and emphasizes that it is unattached and hovering, which is the same visual/physics anomaly highlighted in the ground truth. Although the generated report mentions only one floating weapon rather than two, the essential defect—guns floating instead of resting naturally—is the same. Thus, both reports address the identical underlying issue of floating weapon models.",True

This is not a natural or intentional design and indicates a rendering or level geometry glitch.",Floating and Misaligned Staircase Geometry,"The staircase in the game environment is broken and floating, with steps misaligned and not properly connected to the supporting wall or ground. This visual glitch can confuse players, obstruct movement, and potentially allow players to clip through or get stuck, negatively impacting gameplay and immersion.",Environment - Staircase geometry,"Ground truth highlights two distinct visual issues: (1) a character floating unnaturally in mid-air, and (2) a wooden beam clipping through the stairs. The generated report, however, talks about the staircase itself floating/misaligned, causing possible gameplay obstruction; it does not mention a floating character or a wooden beam intersecting the stairs. Because the objects involved (character and beam vs. staircase) and the nature of the glitch (clipping beam and levitating character vs. detached staircase geometry) differ, they do not describe the same core issue.",False

This suggests a rendering or animation glitch where the hand model is not properly attached or aligned with the arm.",Character Hand Model Distortion and Misalignment,"The left hand of the character is visibly detached and distorted, floating awkwardly in front of the torso rather than being connected to the arm. This visual glitch breaks immersion and may confuse players about the character's actions or pose. It could also interfere with hitbox accuracy or animation transitions during gameplay.",Character model (left hand and arm),"Ground truth bug is specifically that the hand penetrates the character’s own mesh – it is inside the torso and comes out through the belly (clipping). The generated report instead says the hand is ""detached and distorted, floating in front of the torso"" (i.e., outside the body and not attached to the arm). Although both talk about an incorrectly positioned hand, one is about internal clipping while the other is about external detachment. These are different visual issues.",False

This suggests a clipping or animation glitch.",Character Holding Animal Upside Down with Incorrect Animation,"The player character is seen carrying an animal upside down, with the animal's legs pointing straight up, which appears unnatural and likely results from an animation or clipping bug. This visual glitch can break immersion and may confuse players about the intended carrying mechanics.",Character model and carried animal animation,"The ground truth states that a person is carrying a dead animal that is positioned incorrectly. The generated report describes the player character carrying an animal upside down, emphasizing the incorrect orientation/animation. Both focus on the same core issue: an incorrectly positioned animal while being carried. No conflicting details are present; orientation upside-down is a specific example of incorrect positioning, consistent with the ground truth.",True

This indicates a collision detection or animation glitch where the game failed to properly separate the two animal models.",Animal Models Overlapping Due to Collision Detection Glitch,"In the gameplay screenshot, a black bull is visually positioned on top of a white cow, which is not a natural or intended behavior. This suggests a collision detection or physics issue where the game allows animal models to overlap and intersect incorrectly. This visual glitch can break immersion and may affect gameplay if the animals' hitboxes or interactions are compromised.",Animal character models (bull and cow),"Ground truth: The issue is that the black bull (and a cow) are floating slightly above the ground, indicating a vertical positioning/levitation problem relative to the terrain. Generated report: Describes the black bull sitting on top of a white cow, implying two animal models overlapping due to faulty collision detection between them, not floating above the ground. The core problems (levitation vs. overlapping models) are different, so they do not describe the same bug.",False

The generated bug report, however, talks about a visual glitch in the user interface where an XP value shows an unintended strikethrough on the digit ‘7’. These issues involve entirely different elements (3D model behavior vs. UI text rendering) and do not share any overlapping symptoms or context.",False

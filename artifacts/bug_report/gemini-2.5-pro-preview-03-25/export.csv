Standard cardboard boxes do not typically glow. This suggests a potential issue with light source placement or the object's interaction with the lighting system.,Lighting Glitch: Cardboard Box Emitting Light,"A cardboard box located on a desk in the office area is emitting a bright, white light from its interior. The light source seems to be inside the box, causing the inner flaps to glow intensely and casting light outwards. This is visually inconsistent for a standard cardboard box and might indicate a misplaced light source or a rendering bug.",Cardboard Box / Lighting,"The ground truth issue describes a character animation/clipping problem where a person’s leg is unnaturally raised and clipping through a desk. The generated report instead talks about a lighting/rendering issue where a cardboard box is emitting light.

This indicates an issue with collision detection or character placement.",NPC Crowd Clipping Through Player Vehicle at Festival Site,"At the Festival Horizon Mexico outpost, several NPCs in the surrounding crowd are visually clipping through the player's car. A female NPC wearing a brown hat is partially embedded in the rear bumper/bodywork of the white vehicle. Another NPC's arm appears to phase through the rear glass/engine cover. This graphical error breaks immersion.","NPCs (Crowd Characters), Player Vehicle","Both descriptions refer to the same underlying problem: crowd/NPC characters intersecting (clipping) with the player’s vehicle. The ground truth cites a green-shirted person and two others whose legs clip, while the generated report mentions a female NPC with a brown hat and another NPC’s arm clipping. Although the specific clothing details differ, the essential issue—multiple NPCs partially embedded in or phasing through the player’s car at the festival/outpost area—is identical.

The ground truth states the character on the left is clipping into the wall. The generated report states that Geralt’s left arm (Geralt being the left-side character) is clipping into a nearby structure (wall/decoration). Although the generated report gives extra detail (specifying arm and naming Geralt), it still identifies the same visual clipping problem between the character and the surrounding environment, matching the ground truth.",True

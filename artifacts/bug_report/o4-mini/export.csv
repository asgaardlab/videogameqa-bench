The upper body remains visible but is locked in an unnatural pose, with arms outstretched and no animations playing. This clipping issue breaks immersion, may confuse players about NPC interaction zones, and could potentially block line-of-sight checks or trigger zones tied to the character model.",Character Model (Teamleader NPC / collision with environment),"Both descriptions refer to a character/NPC whose lower body is sunk beneath the ground while the upper body is visible and stuck in a T-pose (arms outstretched, no animation). The generated report’s added context (""briefing scene"", ""Teamleader NPC"") does not alter the core issue, which is identical to the ground-truth bug.",True

The bike’s collision mesh does not match the visible terrain surface, causing the wheel to clip through and float partly embedded. This breaks physical simulation for vehicle movement, can trap the player’s bike, and disrupts immersion.",Vehicle (motorbike collision mesh),"Ground truth states that the motorcycle’s lower wheel clips into the ground. The generated report describes the motorbike’s front wheel sinking into (clipping into) rock terrain due to collision mismatch. Both point to a wheel of the motorcycle intersecting the ground/terrain rather than resting on it properly, i.e., the same core bug of wheel-ground clipping. Minor differences (front vs. generic lower wheel, ground vs. rock ledge) do not change the essence of the issue.",True

This intersection is noticeable from multiple camera angles and can distract players by breaking the visual cohesion of character and environment. It may also signal potential issues with the cloth simulation or collision boundaries around furniture assets.",Character clothing (cloak),"Ground truth bug: left-side seated character is floating in the air, i.e., whole body/chair positioning offset from environment.
Generated bug: right-side seated NPC’s cloak clips through bench, a clothing-mesh/cloth simulation issue.
They concern different characters (left vs right), different elements (body position vs cloak), and different visual artifacts (floating vs mesh clipping). Therefore they do not describe the same bug.",False
question___ecb5cbd2-a8be-4bf9-9ae6-115742dba01a,o4-mini-2025-04-16,"An NPC is suspended mid-air in a jump animation on the rooftop instead of landing or continuing its path, indicating a collision or AI pathfinding failure that freezes the character in place.",NPC Stuck in Mid-Air Jump on Rooftop,"An AI-controlled NPC is frozen in a jump pose above the rooftop platform. The character neither completes the jump animation nor falls back down, and remains suspended indefinitely. This break in animation and collision handling can block the player’s path, disrupt AI patrol routines, and negatively impact immersion.",Character (NPC),"The ground truth states that “The person on the left side of the image is floating while in a kneeling position.” The key defect is that a character is unnaturally suspended in mid-air. 

The generated report likewise describes “an AI-controlled NPC … frozen in a jump pose above the rooftop platform … remains suspended indefinitely.” This also pinpoints a character who is stuck floating, never landing.

Although the exact pose differs (kneeling vs. jump pose) and the generated report adds extra game-play implications, both reports identify the same core issue: a character is unnaturally hovering in the air instead of being on the ground. Therefore, they refer to the same bug.",True

Only the upper torso, arms, and head appear above the truck bed, making the character look like they are floating or partially inside the vehicle. This visual bug can break player immersion and may indicate issues with mount-point alignment or culling settings for seated characters.",Character model,"Ground truth states: “The male character and the vehicle in the color blue/cyan are clipping.”

Generated report: describes a character (NPC/male character) whose lower body is clipped inside a “turquoise truck” (turquoise is a blue-cyan color). The issue is explicitly that the character model is clipping with the vehicle mesh.

Both reports reference the same core problem: the character model intersects/clips with a blue-cyan vehicle. Additional detail about the body parts missing does not change the fundamental bug, so they describe the same issue.",True

The floating component does not match the tractor’s actual attachment point and can lead to confusion about hitch status. This broken geometry could interfere with ground interaction, collision detection, and player perception of attachment mechanics.",Front hitch linkage assembly (tractor attachment component),"Ground truth states the problem is that the tractor’s wheels are not fully rendered, specifically the front wheel is completely missing. The generated bug report, however, talks about a front hitch/linkage component that appears detached and floating ahead of the tractor. It makes no mention of wheels or missing wheel render issues. Therefore the two reports describe different visual/geometry issues.",False

This makes it visually confusing and difficult to pick up, and could disrupt player movement or obscure sight lines. The weapon should rest naturally on the ground with proper collision and shadow placement.",Dropped weapon object (sniper rifle model),"Both descriptions refer to the same visual issue: a sniper rifle (dropped weapon) is not properly positioned by physics, resulting in it floating above the ground while a portion of its barrel/model is embedded (clipping) in a wall. The generated report adds location details (corner of Long A) and gameplay impact, but these do not change the core issue. Therefore, they describe the same bug.",True

His feet do not make contact with the geometry, indicating a collision/animation anchoring issue.",Player model hovering above stairs,"When the Blu Scout model jumps or lands on this section of the wooden staircase, his feet remain suspended a few inches above the steps rather than colliding properly. This creates a visual discrepancy where the character appears to float, breaking immersion and potentially misleading players about valid collision surfaces.",Player character model (Blu Scout),"The ground truth describes two distinct visual problems occurring together: (1) the character floating in mid-air and (2) a wooden beam clipping through the stairs. The generated bug report only covers the first problem (character hovering) and makes no mention of the wooden beam clipping through the stairs.

Generated report describes a black bull ""suspended above"" the ground (mid-air) and even clipping through another bull. This captures the same central problem: the black bull is not on the ground (levitating). Mentioning clipping through a white bull is an extra detail but does not contradict the core issue; it still indicates the black bull is floating.

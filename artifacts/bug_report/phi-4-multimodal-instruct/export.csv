This could be due to a texture mapping issue where the texture is not being applied correctly to the 3D model. Furthermore, there is a noticeable discrepancy in the lighting and shading between the character's clothing and the wooden wall, which suggests a potential problem with the game's lighting system or the way the textures are being lit.

It does NOT mention any clipping with scenery or a stopped rotor/propeller; the only shared element is that an aircraft seems to float. Because the ground-truth bug specifically involves wall clipping and a non-rotating propeller, while the generated report lacks these details and introduces different issues (bridge context, reflection), they are not describing the same bug.</pre></td>

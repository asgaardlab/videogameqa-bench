Both problems are about object positioning and mesh collision. 

The generated bug report, however, describes a completely different issue—global visuals being washed-out and desaturated, presumably due to lighting or post-processing errors. It mentions nothing about floating objects, clipping, or mesh intersections. Conversely, the ground-truth description does not mention color, lighting, or desaturation problems.

Because the topics of the two reports do not overlap, they clearly do not describe the same bug.</pre></td>

The generated report describes a different issue: the entire shadow is stretched, misaligned, and has an incorrect shape relative to the character’s pose.

It doesn't appear to impact gameplay functionality, but is visually jarring.",Character Model & Horse Model,"The ground truth bug concerns the incorrect positioning of a dead animal that a person is carrying. The generated report instead describes the player character’s legs clipping through a live horse model while mounted or standing near it. The subjects (dead animal vs. horse), the context (carrying vs. riding/standing), and the nature of the positioning issue differ. Therefore, they do not describe the same bug.",False

This is especially noticeable on the bull's body and head, where the expected fur or hide detail is absent. The rest of the environment appears to be rendering textures correctly.",Bull Texture Missing/Corrupted,"The texture for the bull model is either missing or severely corrupted, causing the bull to appear as a flat, untextured object. This significantly detracts from the visual fidelity of the game and breaks immersion. It's unclear if this affects gameplay, but it could potentially impact the bull's visibility or how it interacts with lighting.",Animal (Bull),"Ground truth describes a positional/rendering issue: the bull (and cow) are floating above the ground, implying an incorrect placement or physics bug.

The text is also in a language that doesn't match the game's default, suggesting a localization issue or incorrect display.",UI Clipping and Localization Issue,"The user interface elements are overlapping and clipping through the game world and the player character. This makes the UI difficult to read and negatively impacts the user experience. Additionally, the UI text is displayed in a non-English language, potentially indicating a localization error or incorrect language settings. The progress bars and text boxes are not properly contained within their designated areas.",User Interface (UI),"Ground truth describes a 3D scene issue: airplane wing clipping into wall and plane floating.

This is likely a texture or mesh deformation issue.",Character Model - Distorted Head,"The head of the character model is significantly stretched vertically, resulting in a distorted and unrealistic appearance. This affects the visual fidelity of the character and may be distracting to players. The distortion is noticeable during gameplay and could potentially impact player immersion.",Character Model,Ground truth states the bug is the character’s hand clipping into the body and coming out of the belly.

The left arm is noticeably elongated and bent at an unrealistic angle while holding the weapon. This affects the visual fidelity of the character and may indicate a problem with the animation system or skeletal mesh. It's possible this could occur during specific animations or transitions.,Character Model (Player),"Ground truth describes a rendering issue where most of the player character’s body is completely missing, leaving only the hand and gun visible, giving the appearance of a floating gun. The generated report instead talks about an arm-stretching distortion: the arm is elongated and bent unnaturally, implying the body is present but deformed.

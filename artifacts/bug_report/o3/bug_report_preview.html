Ambient shadows are missing or extremely faint, giving the world a flat, foggy appearance. This makes it difficult to read terrain variation and identify items or enemies at a glance, negatively impacting navigation and combat.

As a result, the weapon, ammo box, and optic appear to be hovering in mid-air. Nearby geometry (e.g., the tank cupola edge) is likewise missing, suggesting the model’s lower LOD or hull mesh failed to load.

Its front legs are hanging in mid-air while its hind legs barely touch the terrain, indicating that the ‘mating’ animation has triggered without a partner model being properly positioned. This floating posture is not physically possible and therefore appears to be a rendering/animation glitch rather than intended behavior.</pre></td>

                        <td class="px-6 py-4 max-w-[400px] break-words"><pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words font-mono text-sm">When the mission objective requires a bull to be mating, the bull sometimes initiates the mounting animation without a cow beneath it. In this state the entire bull model hovers above ground level, with no supporting geometry, causing obvious visual clipping and immersion issues. Because the game still tags the bull as ‘mating,’ players may be confused about whether the objective requirements are met. Additionally, the floating bull can impede melee or shooting hit-detection, potentially blocking mission progress.</pre></td>

Generated report: describes a situation where the bull model ‘hovers above ground level, with no supporting geometry,’ i.e., floating in mid-air. This is the same core visual issue: the bull is floating rather than being aligned with the ground. The generated report adds extra context (mating animation, objective confusion, hit-detection), and omits mention of the cow also floating, but it still captures the essential problem of the bull model floating. Therefore both describe the same bug.</pre></td>

Because the ribbon has a solid grey tint, it visually slices through the text, making the first digit almost invisible and the rest of the number hard to read.

The generated report concerns a UI issue where XP text is obscured by a background ribbon on a results screen.

    &quot;reasoning&quot;: &quot;This appears to be an intentional game design element rather than a glitch.

The image shows what appears to be a mechanical or anatomical model head with one half showing a porcelain-like surface with phrenological markings, and the other half revealing muscular/anatomical details underneath. This is likely from a horror or steampunk-themed game where such medical models would be period-appropriate props.
